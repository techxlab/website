At the core of JOY's activity is a training program that teaches thousands of villagers how to create nutrient-rich fertilizer through vermiculture, a process of composting that uses live earthworms, manure and green waste. Villagers can secure a livelihood by selling the fertilizer to farmers, who in turn benefit from organic farming practices.\n\n## TEL's Role\n\nAfter conducting a field visit in Karnataka in late 2013, TEL began working with JOY to both raise the public profile of the movement through the creation and promotion of original content, and to secure partnerships with a major agrarian foundation in India: Morarka Organic in Rajasthan.\n\n## Results\n\nJOY secured a grant from the National Skills and Development Council of India, along with microloans to enroll and train 1,067 beneficiaries across 100 villages, in the first year. Beneficiaries have earned, on average, 3-4x their initial training fee, by selling organic fertilizers and surplus earthworms.  Farmers’ yields have increased, on average, by 50-60% by using organic fertilizers. Increased income generation has also led to expanded financial inclusion, and a reduction of rural flight as families and young adults find new opportunities at home. In its second year, JOY will enroll an additional 1,832 beneficiaries.\n\n"},{"name":"Light Up Karnataka","_href":"/studies/light-up-karnataka/","template":"study","_txt":"# [Light Up Karnataka](/studies/light-up-karnataka/)\nUpdated 12 September 2016\n\n## The Project\n\nLight Up Karnataka is a joint initiative between TEL and [Brothers Integrated Rural Development Society](http://birdsbangalore.org/index.html) (BIRDS) to power rural homes with point-of-use solar lighting solutions.  By training local female sales agents and outfitting remote retail shops with inventories of solar lights through a microconsignment model, the program creates employment opportunities for local entrepreneurs, while also providing a safe, cost-effective and sustainable alternative to kerosene lamps and candles for thousands of families.\n\n## TEL's Role\n\nUpon engaging the organization through a detailed needs assessment, TEL initially identified and procured demo solar lighting solutions from five different providers for field testing and product focus groups. TEL also led fundraising efforts to purchase inventory and fund the entrepreneurship training program. TEL and BIRDS work continuously to monitor, evaluate and optimize the performance of the program.\n\n\n## Results\n\nAfter field testing five demo units and conducting extensive interviews with key participants, three Greenlight Planet solar lighting models were selected as viable solutions that responded to users’ expressed needs and aspirations.

The mechanisms within the filter include both mechanical and biological processes. Mechanical processes include straining, adhesion and adsorption within the sand, whereas biological processes include predation by other organisms, die-off and inactivation and competition for food.\n\nAs micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and parasites travel through the sand, they are subject to both of these removal mechanisms. Over time, a biological zone gradually develops within the top layers the sand, the most dense/active part being the top few centimetres of sand – the origins of this biological population being the raw water fed into the filter. These micro-organisms form part of an active food chain that consumes pathogens (disease-causing organisms) as they are trapped in and on the sand surface, and in so doing the pathogens are removed and safe drinking water is produced. \n\nBioSandFilter.org is a resource website linking efforts by field practitioners and academics doing research on the biosand filter. It gives filter and mould instructions for those who want to make their own. Equally, for those that require it, moulds can be bought by BushProof, the Madagascar-based company that owns BioSandFilter.org.

Many of these children never enjoy the pleasure of being read to as their families don’t know sign language. Videobooks also helps bridge the gap in literacy skills between deaf and hearing students.\n\nIn this way, the readers become linguistic models, families share stories with deaf children, teachers find tools they can use for education and society can become more inclusive as a whole.

By using these readily available resources to construct greenhouses, construction and operational costs are minimized and organic cultivation is achieved. As a result, desert greenhouses produce social, economic and ecological benefits.\n\nGrooves are dug in the sand which hold tree bark, sawdust, poultry manure or oil cake mixed evenly with sandy soil. When fully fermented, this mixture creates a vegetative environment in which seedlings can be planted. The temperature in the desert greenhouse is usually between 15 and 25 degrees centigrade for most kinds of planted fruits and vegetables. The operational greenhouse in China shows positive results as eggplants, peppers, watermelons, tomatoes and other crops prosper.\n\nThe annual cost to maintain a greenhouse is around $3,200 USD.

As the liver becomes damaged by potent medications, these two enzymes, usually found in the liver, are released into the blood stream. From a single drop of whole blood, this test will determine whether blood levels of these two enzymes are baseline/normal, greater than two-times baseline/normal, or greater than five-times baseline/normal. The 2x and 5x thresholds, which indicate that treatments should be “monitored closely” or “altered immediately”, correspond to protocols established by the U.S. FDA to guide treatment during clinical trials.\n\nThe liver function test is targeted to cost $0.10 or less, will be about the size of a postage stamp, and will function without external power or equipment.

The biochar application is useful as a means of carbon sequestration and mitigating global warming issues too.\n\nThe value of charcoal was known to Indians and utilized as part of traditional and cultural practices for various purposes. The charcoal was never considered as a waste material. The crop residue burnt in the fields gets converted into charcoal and ash. In the process, the earth (soil) also gets burnt. This practice benefited the soils and farmers since ages (here no comparison with composting the biomass). The slash and burn in the margins of the forests or inside the forests is a very well known practice all over India (although it is no more sustainable because of huge population demands and costing the sustainability of forests). The charcoal, a byproduct of the traditional stoves is added to the farm yard manure / compost, which gets inoculated with the soil microbes, which was later transferred to the fields. The waste from the potters kiln a combination of charcoal, pottery shards and little ash was always a valuable source for improving the fertility of the soils. Although the addition of charcoal to the soils was existing as a practice, but it was not explicit, it remained as part of traditional best practices in India. As we explore more and more evidences are visible and proves that the Indian farmers were using charcoal since hundreds of years.

In practice, the transplanted seedling will receive just enough water from the Waterboxx to survive while it still searches for water deep in the soil. It will therefore develop a strong taproot, making the whole plant resilient to prolonged drought periods.\n\nThe technology works on the same principle as nature: once the seed germinates and develops its root in the capillary column, it reaches water. The leaves then develop and evaporation and photosynthesis can start.

When an invading insect is detected, custom software is able to estimate the insect’s size and also to measure its wing beat frequency. Using this method, not only can the system distinguish between mosquitoes, butterflies, and bumblebees, but it can also determine whether a mosquito is male or female, as only female mosquitoes bite humans.\n\nOnce the software establishes that the insect is a valid target, it tracks the mosquito in flight, runs a safety check to ensure no innocent bystanders are in view, and then activates a laser to zap the mosquito. The Photonic Fence could be set along the perimeter of clinics or other strategic areas to control mosquitoes without endangering humans or other animals.\n\n"},{"name":"KB Treadle Pump","_href":"/solutions/international-development-enterprises-india-idei-kb-treadle-pump","template":"solution","category":["agriculture","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","irrigation"],"id":"67","_txt":"The Treadle Pump is a foot operated water lifting device for easy irrigation of small holder plots of land.  A treadle pump can be used by all members of a farming family to irrigate crops. The user stands on two treadles, usually made of bamboo, and pedals them. This light exercise, similar to using a step machine, operates two metal pump-cylinders which are connected to a tube-well, or to a surface level pond. The tube-well consists of robust, flexible plastic, sunk into the ground until it reaches an aquifer. Before first use, water is poured into the cylinders to ‘prime’ the pump. When the user pedals, water is lifted up onto the field, or into a pond or irrigation canal. The pedalling action is easily mastered and not strenuous, so that anyone in the family can take a turn at irrigating the fields. Typically the household will operate a pump for between two and eight hours per day, often in the early morning or evening when the weather is cool.\n\nDirect impacts of Treadle Pump irrigation\n\n - The income impact of the Treadle Pump technology varies across households and regions, but US$400 per year is the estimate of the average increase in the annual net income of each household\n\n- It frees the farmer from the limitations of rain fed farming and raises his capacity to grow crops in both winter and summer\n\n - Land augmenting : For the poor farmers constrained by the small size of the landholdings, treadle pump technology acts as a land augmenting intervention. With the use of Treadle Pump the farmers can cultivate all the year round thus increasing their cropping intensity to 200-300%.\n\n - Easy and productive : The Treadle pump is easier to use and is more productive than a variety of traditional manual irrigation devices. Its output is in the range of 4000-4500 litres/hour with a lift of 4-7 m.\n\n- Change in cropping pattern : Treadle Pump technology enables the farmers to grow crops they were not able to grow earlier, example- farmers are able to grow vegetables and make more money by selling them\n\n- The most significant impact is the increase in the crop yield\n\n- Among the most important reason cited by farmers themselves is the leaching away of the fertilizers due to the strong water currents generated by the diesel pumps (traditionally used by farmers for irrigation during non-monsoon seasons)\n\n - Farming families have a better diet with more vegetables and milk, and plenty of surplus produce to sell\n\n- Acumen Fund survey showed that helping with pumping did not add to chores of children or prevent them attending school\n\n- TUV Nord has verified greenhouse gas savings from avoided diesel as 0.477 tonnes/year CO2 per pump.\n\n\n"},{"name":"Purdue Improved Crop Storage Bags","_href":"/solutions/international-programs-in-agriculture-purdue-improved-crop-storage-bags","template":"solution","category":["agriculture","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","productivity-tools"],"id":"642","_txt":"The Purdue Improved Crop Storage (​PICS) project aims to increase the income of farming families in West and ​Central Africa through the use of inexpensive, plastic grain storage bags.

A corn sheller can be made at a fraction of the cost of market alternatives.\n\nThe D-Lab program at MIT, in collaboration with their community partners, has developed several versions of the maize sheller that can be made using locally available materials and methods.  The process requires only a hammer, pliers and a tool to cut the sheet metal into the appropriate size to accommodate the local varieties of maize.\n\nA corn sheller can be made by forming ridges on a curved piece of sheet metal.  It can also  be made by using a straight piece of sheet metal with tapered ridges to produce a similar surface. A simple jig was also developed for making these shellers quickly and easily (see link to additional documentation, below).\n\n\n"},{"name":"Grassroots Mapping, Balloon Aerial Photography","_href":"/solutions/mit-media-lab-grassroots-mapping-balloon-aerial-photography","template":"solution","category":"education","id":"110","_txt":"Grassroots Mapping is a series of participatory mapping projects involving communities in cartographic dispute.\n\n"},{"name":"Konbit","_href":"/solutions/mit-media-lab-konbit","template":"solution","category":"education","tags":"connectivity","id":"207","_txt":"The Konbit system aims to connect workers in Haiti with NGO's that need assistance.

It can boil about 1.5 liters of water in less than eight minutes.  It is like cooking on a stove powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), except that the fuel comes free: It uses rice husks, a farm waste common in agricultural countries like the Philippines. Unlike earlier devices this stove converts the husks into gas to emit a cleaner flame which helps the environment. “It will help minimize the problem of rice husk disposal which contributes a lot to environmental pollution,\" says the inventor.\n\nThe stove has the following advantages as compared to other commercially available stoves:\n\n1. It uses no cost rice husk fuel, which means cost savings to users\n\n2. It is convenient to operate since the start-up of fuel can be done by using pieces of paper, and gas is ignited using a match stick\n\n3. Almost no smoke can be observed during cooking. 4. It can cook rice and two viands per cooking, which is\ngood enough for a family of 4 to 6 members\n\n5. The degree of burning the fuel can be controlled using a rotary switch. Hence, the amount of flame on the burner can be regulated\n\n6.

It is also adoptable for battery, in case of brown out, by using an appropriate-sized inverter\n\n8. It is safe to operate with no danger of explosion since the stove operates at a normal atmospheric pressure.\n\nSome of the limitations of the stove are:\n\n1. It is difficult to use in areas where rice husks are not available. It cannot be used for other biomass material since the design was made for rice husks.\n\n2. It needs hauling of fuel when the source of rice husks is from a distance. In cities or urban areas, there is a need for a separate enterprise to ensure the supply of this fuel.\n\n3. Loading of fuel and unloading of burned rice husks are quite inconvenient. This is most especially true to households that are used to operating LPG stoves.\n\n4.

Babies who don’t weigh enough at birth are terribly vulnerable. Their bodies are not strong, and they may have a difficult time breathing, eating, gaining weight, and fighting infection. Babies who weigh less than 2.5 kg at birth are approximately 20 times more likely to die than heavier infants.\n\nMany babies in the developing world are delivered at home, by traditional birth attendants or midwives who may lack the training and tools to recognize low birth weight. PATH’s BIRTHweigh scale helps low-literate health workers identify low-birthweight children immediately. Once identified, these infants can be given care, such as immediate breastfeeding and warming, or referred for higher levels of medical care. The BIRTHweigh scale compensates for low levels of literacy by supplying pictorial instructions for use. It depends on a simple indicator for low birth weight and is easy to use; little training is required, allowing health workers in the developing world to detect low birth weight in infants before complications arise.\n\nTo use the BIRTHweigh scale, health workers place the baby in a secure sling that is suspended by a hook on the scale. Instead of the common digital or dial readouts that report an infant’s exact weight, the first version of the scale had a window that shows yellow if the baby’s weight is too low and blue if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kg, the desired weight for a healthy newborn.\n\nDuring tests in Indonesia—where 250,000 Indonesian infants die each year from preventable illnesses—we found that during night deliveries, in huts with little or no lighting, birth attendants were unable see the color change. PATH took the recommendations of the midwives and field testers and modified the scale to include a tactile indicator on the top of the handle. The indicator button sinks into the grip if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kilograms, and birth attendants can feel whether babies are at a healthy weight, even in the dark.\n\n"},{"name":"Chlorhexidine for Umbilical Cord Care","_href":"/solutions/path-chlorhexidine-for-umbilical-cord-care","template":"solution","category":"medical","tags":"women-and-children, vaccination","id":"374","_txt":" Chlorhexidine, a low-cost antiseptic, prevents deadly infections that enter an infant’s body through a newly cut umbilical cord.

For rabies vaccine, the same or better protection can be achieved by delivering smaller amounts of vaccine intradermally (into the top layer of the skin), sparing valuable doses and stretching supplies to provide for more patients. Intradermal (ID) regimens for rabies vaccine have been adopted in many regions, protecting people who have been exposed to rabid animals, while saving costs and vaccine.\n\nThis approach is not yet universal, despite clear benefits, due in part to the difficulty of giving an ID injection correctly. The Mantoux technique, which uses a traditional needle and syringe for ID delivery, has historically been recognized as a difficult and inconsistently used technique. In many countries, only certain health care workers are able to perform ID injections, such as for rabies vaccine and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin or BCG, a vaccine given intradermally at birth to prevent tuberculosis. Smaller ID doses of other vaccines could also be effective. Such dose sparing could be particularly meaningful to immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries, as they could potentially reduce the amount of vaccine needed per patient, thereby cutting costs and overcoming vaccine shortages. However, concerns regarding the difficulty and a lack of reliability of conventional ID injections limit research in this field and introduction of this technique into immunization programs.\n\nThe intradermal adapter makes ID injections easier. It facilitates the procedure by standardizing injection depth and angle. It is anticipated that the ID adapter would expand the pool of health care workers capable of performing the procedure. This would have a particularly high impact in remote or underserved communities with more limited access to health care specialists.\n\n"},{"name":"Jet Injector","_href":"/solutions/path-jet-injector","template":"solution","category":"medical","tags":"vaccination,  medical-devices","id":"138","_txt":"Injections without needles?

Birth asphyxia/trauma—the condition when a baby does not breathe at birth—is the third most common cause of newborn deaths, accounting for 23 percent of all fatalities. Limited data suggest that deaths due to birth asphyxia have remained relatively unchanged in developing countries. The key to reducing these deaths is the provision of appropriate care to underserved populations during delivery. Approximately 50 million women give birth without a skilled attendant, 99 percent of whom live in low-income countries. Appropriate care for birth asphyxia requires that neonatal resuscitation skills and appropriate technology should be available to all skilled birth attendants and to community-level workers where skilled attendants are not available.\n\nEffective neonatal resuscitation equipment is needed by all birth attendants in order to reduce the danger of birth asphyxiation. Neonatal resuscitator technologies that are affordable and easy to use, clean, and store could increase the use of such lifesaving devices in the developing world.

Each year, nearly 80 million women experience unintended pregnancies, about half of these end in abortion. Hundreds of millions of women annually suffer disability from pregnancy complications, and more than 500,000 die as a result of pregnancy, childbirth, or unsafe abortion. Almost all these deaths are preventable. Women also represent more than 50 percent of people living with AIDS; and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), excluding HIV/AIDS, are the second most important cause of loss of health in women, especially young women. Women want and need more female-initiated methods that can protect against pregnancy and STIs. Diaphragms could help meet this need, but some characteristics of traditional diaphragms limit their use and acceptability.\n\nPATH responded to the call for simple-to-use, female barrier protection by developing the SILCS Diaphragm, a single-size, reusable device with a contoured rim that allows the SILCS Diaphragm to fit most women with improved comfort. Design and development of the SILCS Diaphragm began in 1994, and user-centered evaluations of over 200 prototype designs refined performance and features. The single-size design will simplify the logistics of supply and provision. PATH used stakeholder assessments to ensure that comfort, ease of handling, and acceptability were built into the product. As a result, the SILCS Diaphragm directly addresses user and programmatic needs which will lead to improved access and acceptability. Acceptability studies among naïve users in South Africa and  Thailand found that women were able to learn to use the device easily and that women and men found the SILCS Diaphragm acceptable during use. In a comparative crossover study of the SILCS Diaphragm with a traditional diaphragm in the Dominican Republic, 19 of 20 women reported preferring the SILCS Diaphragm device after short-term use. Eventually, the single-size device could be provided over the counter or outside the clinic-based system where regulatory authority and clinical practice allow.\n\n"},{"name":"SoloShot","_href":"/solutions/path-soloshot","template":"solution","category":"medical","tags":"vaccination","id":"141","_txt":"Although sterile, disposable syringes and needles o\fffer the best protection against transmission of bloodborne diseases, they are o\bften reused in the developing world. Each year, more than 12 billion injections are administered worldwide; in developing countries 50 percent of injections are estimated to be unsafe. A primary source of transmission of disease has been the reuse of contaminated needles and syringes. To be completely safe, single-use injection devices must be designed to automatically and irrevocably inactivate a\bfter a single cycle of filling and injection. The World Health Organization/Expanded Programme on Immunization (WHO/EPI) called for the design of such devices in 1987.\n\nIn response to WHO’s call, PATH designed one of the first feasible approaches to nonreusable syringes for immunizations: an autodisable (AD) syringe with a fixed needle that automatically locks a\bfter a single injection. When the syringe is filled to the preset 0.5-ml level, the plunger stops and cannot be pulled back further. A\bfter the vaccine is injected, the plunger automatically locks so that the syringe and needle cannot be reused. Known as the SoloShot syringe, this technology was licensed to and is now manufactured and marketed by BD, one of the world’s leading syringe manufacturers. Third-party field validations of the device in Pakistan in the early 1990s demonstrated the acceptability and usability of the design.

Briquettes are a proven technology that provides a low-cost fuel for households that is locally made and can be used as an alternative to wood or charcoal. Fuel briquettes can also be used in institutions for large scale cooking, and in industries for production use.\n\nThere are two types of eco-fuel briquettes:\n1. Non-carbonized fuel briquettes: these are produced from waste materials that are not carbonized such as saw dust, and waste paper.\n2.

After setting up the water containers, the water slowly drips out of the containers through a tube, which can be attached to a water filter. This slow drip creates a slow shift in weight, so throughout the day, the solar panel changes position and tilts as the sun moves across the sky, and the water drips out of the containers. This makes the solar panel perpendicular to the sun all day as it moves from sunrise to sunset.\n\nAt the end of the day, when the sun is down, the water has completely dripped out of the containers and through the filter, creating clean water. As a result, the solar panel has harvested 30% more energy from the sun by remaining perpendicular to the sun all day.\n\n"},{"name":"SHE LaunchPad","_href":"/solutions/sustainable-health-enterprises-she-launchpad","template":"solution","category":["medical","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","women-and-children"],"id":"563","_txt":"SHE is an organization that helps women jumpstart social businesses to manufacture and distribute affordable menstrual pads.

Secondly, the details on the matriculation number of the bus are also logged. When the passenger clicks on send, the information comes to the Safe Travel server and a file is created with the bus matriculation number. This file then consists of names of relatives and their contacts who can locate his/her position during a journey, as well as report an incident or make a complaint such as reckless driving by the bus driver.    \n\nA third aspect ensures that passengers and users can log on during their journey to check their location in real time.

However, in comparison to other powerful non-electric pumps with the same application, the WaterBuck exceeds the peak capacity of a 12-foot-diameter windmill by 60%.\n\nThe WaterBuck Pump is a water supply system for communities that have static water levels up to 200 feet with a capacity of up to 55 gallons per-minute. It can also pump uphill, supply water for furrow irrigation and pressurize tanks for drip irrigation or indoor plumbing. The pump can be adapted to accommodate a second lever and twin cylinders, allowing capacity to double with two to four operators pumping simultaneously.  A manual well pump of this caliber can be a great long-term asset for off-grid homesteaders and communities in developing countries. \n\n"},{"name":"Mobile Monitor (MoMo)","_href":"/solutions/welldone-mobile-monitor-momo","template":"solution","category":"water","id":"456","_txt":"The MoMo mobile monitor attaches to water pumps and collects and transmits data on water flow and frequency of use.

You kick-start the cooking process by heating your pot of food on the stove, then place it in the Wonderbag.\n\nWonderbag's insulating properties allow food that has been brought to the boil to finish cooking while in the bag. This greatly reduces the use of additional energy. This means families can cook hot meals while saving energy and money. It also means less time tending to the cooking food. Now time can be better spent looking after children, earning an income or doing essential chores.  The slowed cooking process, combined with sealing the pot in the Wonderbag, ensures the flavours and nutrients are retained inside the pot - not evaporated into thin air.\n\nBenefits:\n- Can reduce a family's fuel usage up to 30% - saving money and easing poverty\n- Reduces CO2 emissions\n- Reduces toxic fumes which means less respiratory problems and other diseases, particularly in children\n- Reduces accidents in the kitchen, because stoves are used less\n- Reduces time spent cooking, giving more time for child-care and other activities\n- Saves water: when the pot is insulated in a Wonderbag at a fairly constant temperature, less evaporation occurs, so less water is needed\n- Saves food: 20% of all staple food in Africa is burned, due to pots being placed on open fires and unregulated stove tops.

Kenyan adolescent girls miss approximately 3.5 million learning days per month due to lack of funds to purchase sanitary pads. This impedes their ability to compete in the classroom, leads to low self-esteem, higher drop-out rates and, in many areas of Kenya, makes them vulnerable to early marriage.\n\nZanaA has found a long-term and holistic solution to this problem, which is to establish a sustainable business creating locally-produced, environmentally-safe sanitary pads in Kenya while advocating for greater policy support of girls.\n\nFirst, ZanaA plans to coordinate, on-line, the national distribution of sanitary pads, to ensure all vendors are distributing proper sanitary pads and with synchronized training in sanitary pad use and disposal as well as age-appropriate sexual maturation education.\n\nThis will help reduce the logistical burden of sanitary pad distribution, ensure sexual predators are not given entry to the school, distribute pads at the convenience of the school curriculum, enable equitable distribution across the country, and reduce the cost burden to donors. Along with this comes the development of a tool kit for enhancing policy around girls and education.\n\nSecond, ZanaA has become the exclusive distributor to the informal market (including school girls) for a sanitary pad invented by Dr. Musaazi of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, called MakaPads™, made from local, easily replenishable natural resources.\n\nMakaPads has been approved by the Ugandan Bureau of Standards, is in the final stage of registering with the Kenyan Bureau of Standards, and is pending international patent. This is the first of several solutions, to provide sanitary pad production opportunities using available natural resources.\n\nThird, ZanaA is interesting in networking with any producers of sanitary pads and any organizations who provide or who are planning to provide sanitary pads to schools because the world can handle many solutions for different contexts.
