<h2 id="where-is-tel-located-">Where is TEL located?</h2>

<p>Technology Exchange Lab
Cambridge Innovation Center
1 Broadway, 14th Floor
Cambridge, MA 02142
United States</p>
<p>Although TEL is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, members of the TEL team contribute to our cause from around the world, including Washington, D.C., New York, California, India, Japan, France, and Chile.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-i-join-tel-as-a-member-">Why should I join TEL as a member?</h2>
<p>By joining TEL as a member, you will be able to add solutions to the database, leave your comments and reviews on solution pages and receive updates from the field.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-point-of-use-solution-">What is a “point-of-use” solution?</h2>
<p>Point-of-use (POU) solutions are portable, adaptable, low-cost and can be easily implemented at the site of use.  POU solutions stand in stark contrast to larger, centralized and costly technology that delivers benefits from a distance.  While some solutions are ready-made products available for purchase, others may be manufactured locally based off of open source ‘do-it-yourself’ designs.  </p>
<h2 id="who-can-add-a-solution-to-the-database-">Who can add a solution to the database?</h2>
<p>Anyone is welcome to add a solution to the database, and it is free!  Simply join TEL and go to ‘Add Solutions’.  Don’t have time to submit a solution?  Just send us a quick tip and we’ll do the rest!</p>
<h2 id="which-solutions-are-best-for-my-organization-community-">Which solutions are best for my organization / community?</h2>
<p>The best solutions for your organization or communities are those that respond to the unique needs of the end user.  If you need help in exploring the solutions that are most desirable, feasible and viable for your organization/community, sign up to our Project Accelerator program for a free consultation.</p>
<h2 id="can-tel-help-with-the-acquisition-of-solution-demo-units-">Can TEL help with the acquisition of solution demo units?</h2>
<p>Absolutely! While tell does not sell any of the solutions listed on its website nor receive any commissions or compensation from solution providers, we are glad to help facilitate conversations between solution providers and solution seekers to accelerate the exchange of solutions.  Contact us to learn more.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-change-or-update-information-about-a-solution-i-ve-already-contributed-to-the-tel-database-how-do-i-edit-my-solution-page-">I want to change or update information about a solution I&#39;ve already contributed to the TEL database. How do I edit my solution page?</h2>
<p>All changes to solution pages must be made by a member of our TEL team in order to ensure the unbiased nature of the database.  We believe in the high value of providing a carefully curated information source and allowing direct editing would result in the loss of control over the database content.</p>
<p>Users who wish to edit their solution page content have two options: contact us with the necessary changes and we will update the page within 72 hours; submit a new solution page and we will delete the existing version.</p>
<h2 id="is-tel-currently-seeking-new-partnerships-">Is TEL currently seeking new partnerships?</h2>
<p>Yes, we are always exploring new partnerships in order to better facilitate the delivery of point-of-use technology to last-mile communities.  Please contact us if you are interested in exploring a new collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-tel-funded-and-how-does-it-operate-">How is TEL Funded and how does it operate?</h2>
<p>TEL is registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. We don&#39;t sell goods or services, nor do we accept any commissions for the publication and/or exchange of information on solutions. TEL is a bootstrapped operation funded and supported by volunteer time and supporter donations of funds and administrative support services.</p>
<p>TEL is incorporated as a nonprofit charity in California, under that State&#39;s laws regulating corporate organization and executive and staff compensation.
