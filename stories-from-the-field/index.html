      <h2>Fundación Organizmo</h2>
      <p>Posted by <a href="">Brennan Lake</a> 7 April 2015 4:14 pm</p>
      <p>"Small is beautiful." So goes the title of British economist, E.F. Schumacher’s manifesto. While his appropriate technology movement has been eclipsed by a wave of social entrepreneurs who 'Design for Extreme Affordability', Schumacher's mantra is alive and well in Bogotá, Colombia. Located on a small farm tucked between the foothills of the Eastern Andes, Fundación Organizmo is a crucible where diverse methods in sustainable architecture blend with locally sourced and recycled...</p>

      <h2>JOY: From Grassroots to Organic Revolution in Southern India</h2>
      <p>Posted by <a href="">Brennan Lake</a> 20 March 2014 12:00 am</p>
      <p>What would it take to revitalize depleted soil in an area the size of Nebraska while also economically empowering low-income populations and women?  Governments often turn to investment in chemicals and infrastructure as the obvious approach.  But at the grassroots level in Karnataka, India, it's all being accomplished with worms, women, a few low-cost tablets and cartloads of manure.  Jaya Organic Yojana (JOY) is not a business or an NGO, but rather a movement that leverages...</p>
