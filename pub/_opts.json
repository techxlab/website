Meanwhile, the clinic staff was frustrated in its efforts to find appropriate equipment by the lack of a unified, reliable source of information. In order to meet this need on a global basis, she and fellow MIT Sloan School alumnus Gary L. Bergstrom began designing the basics of TEL, with the goal of leveraging technology to help families and communities rise from poverty. After studying political science and economics in Munich, Karen worked as an industrial organization instructor and journalist. She subsequently completed a Master's degree in Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. As a case manager with the Boston Consulting Group she has consulted to international clients in a variety of industries. Volunteering with the St. Boniface Centre de Santi in Haiti, Karen helped out in the medical-surgical clinic and served as board member and CFO. Two school-years spent in Japan resulted in a deep connection to that country.

While some solutions are ready-made products available for purchase, others may be manufactured locally based off of open source ‘do-it-yourself’ designs.  \n\n## Who can add a solution to the database?\nAnyone is welcome to add a solution to the database, and it is free!  Simply join TEL and go to ‘Add Solutions’.  Don’t have time to submit a solution?  Just send us a quick tip and we’ll do the rest!\n\n## Which solutions are best for my organization / community?\nThe best solutions for your organization or communities are those that respond to the unique needs of the end user.  If you need help in exploring the solutions that are most desirable, feasible and viable for your organization/community, sign up to our Project Accelerator program for a free consultation.\n\n## Can TEL help with the acquisition of solution demo units?\nAbsolutely! While tell does not sell any of the solutions listed on its website nor receive any commissions or compensation from solution providers, we are glad to help facilitate conversations between solution providers and solution seekers to accelerate the exchange of solutions.  Contact us to learn more.\n\n## I want to change or update information about a solution I've already contributed to the TEL database. How do I edit my solution page?\nAll changes to solution pages must be made by a member of our TEL team in order to ensure the unbiased nature of the database.  We believe in the high value of providing a carefully curated information source and allowing direct editing would result in the loss of control over the database content.\n\nUsers who wish to edit their solution page content have two options: contact us with the necessary changes and we will update the page within 72 hours; submit a new solution page and we will delete the existing version.\n\n## Is TEL currently seeking new partnerships?\nYes, we are always exploring new partnerships in order to better facilitate the delivery of point-of-use technology to last-mile communities.  Please contact us if you are interested in exploring a new collaboration.\n\n## How is TEL Funded and how does it operate?\nTEL is registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. We don't sell goods or services, nor do we accept any commissions for the publication and/or exchange of information on solutions. TEL is a bootstrapped operation funded and supported by volunteer time and supporter donations of funds and administrative support services.\n\nTEL is incorporated as a nonprofit charity in California, under that State's laws regulating corporate organization and executive and staff compensation. The founder-directors who constitute the executive board and the CEO receive no compensation. TEL's work style is cooperative rather than hierarchical. We rely on the effort, input and ideas of our volunteers, research associates, interns and members. We welcome hearing from anyone interested in participating, and we respond to all queries.\n\n## My question was not answered.\nContact us and let us know how we can help!\n"

She's thinking about how to cook dinner in a Haitian slum. Most of Haiti has been deforested, few people have electricity, and fossil fuels are prohibitively expensive. But there's something Haiti has a lot of: bagasse, or sugar-cane fibers left over after processing. Smith and her students have developed a way to turn this plentiful (and otherwise useless) material into clean-burning charcoal by carbonizing it in a covered oil drum. It's a simple solution to a simple problem, but—like many of Smith's projects—it makes a big difference in ordinary people's lives.\n\nSmith, a practitioner of humanitarian engineering, wants to solve everyday problems for rural families in the developing world: where to find clean water, how to preserve vegetables for market, how to do laundry without electricity or plumbing. Smith's inventions include a hammer mill for grinding grain into flour—a task African women usually do by hand—and a portable kit to test drinking water for contaminating bacteria. Smith, who was awarded a Macarthur Fellowship in 2004, runs MIT's IDEAS Competition, for which teams of student engineers design projects to make life easier in the developing world.\n\n*What would you say was the coolest project that you've worked on?*\n\nWell, it's not very romantic, but I think our charcoal project is going to have a huge impact, because it allows you to have a clean-burning fuel without cutting down trees. We're planning large-scale dissemination in Haiti. There's no glitz factor to it, but it's probably going to make a huge amount of difference.\n\n*Have the inventions that come out of your class and out of the IDEAS competition proved successful in the field?*\n\nSome of the IDEAS competition winners have been very successful. The compound water filter, which removes arsenic and pathogens, is now deployed quite extensively in Nepal. The Kinkajou microfilm projector, used in nighttime literacy classes, is being deployed in Mali. We’re working to commercialize a system for testing water for potability. It's in the field in several countries, but not on a widespread basis. We're looking towards doing a trial of aerosol vaccines in Pakistan, so that's exciting.\n\n*What is the biggest problem facing rural communities in the developing world?*\n\nI don't think you can say there's a single one. Obviously access to safe drinking water is a huge problem, and lack of access to opportunities, and general poverty. But if you get people safe drinking water, and then they still have no way to earn any money to feed their families, you still have a problem. And if you give them better methods of agricultural processing or ways to create clean energy, but there's still drinking water that makes them sick, you still have a problem. There are too many interrelated issues, so solving one problem won't completely change the lives of millions.\n\n*You lived in India as a child and you were in the Peace Corps in Botswana in the 1980s. How did those experiences lead to what you're doing now?*\n\nAs a very young child I was exposed to very severe poverty, so I always wanted to do something to help kids around the world. Living in India is something that stayed with me—I could put faces on the kids who had so little money. In Botswana, I was teaching and then working for the ministry of agriculture as a beekeeper, and I remember thinking to myself that I really liked doing development work, but I wished could do some engineering too, because I like creative problem solving. People in the developing world scrape every last ounce of life that they can out of objects, and my students used to bring me things to fix, and I always enjoyed being able to do that.\n\n*You’ve said that engineering schools focus too much on defense and consumer electronics—what changes would you like to see in the way engineering is taught?*\n\nAdvertisementIt would be great if students recognized that engineering with a humanitarian focus is as legitimate as aerospace and automotive engineering. Service learning is actually a very good way to teach engineering, because it motivates students to continue, and it appeals especially to women and minorities.\n\n*You are a woman in what is still a male-dominated field. What can we do to encourage more women to become engineers?*\n\nActually, because my class involves humanitarian engineering, I very rarely have more men than women. There have been times where there have been ten women and one man. This isn't surprising, given that women often want to see an application to what they're learning that they feel is worthwhile. But I'm not involved in any particular projects to encourage women engineers, because I dislike being referred to as a woman engineer. I don't like programs that single out woman engineers as particular achievers just for being women. I think that it should be coincidental. What we should be striving for is a world where when we see women or minorities who are high achievers, it isn't surprising. We shouldn't be thinking, \"Good for them!\" just because of their race or gender. I think we're a long, long way from that, but I don't think we should keep implying that there's something special about being a woman engineer. I want people who meet me to say, \"I like the work that you're doing.\" I want to be known as an engineer who designs solutions for the developing world. After that people can notice that I'm a woman.\n"

Archimedes Project founder Faith Wallace notes that, while many interventions have been successful in reducing the number of infections and deaths, the disease has yet to be eliminated from Haiti. Without a stronger response, the epidemic is likely to persist.\n\n“Conditions are perfect for cholera: 80 percent of the people lack sanitation coverage in Haiti, and 50 percent lack access to clean water. If nothing changes to treat the problem, the disease will continue to devastate Haiti as a yearly endemic as it has Bangladesh.”\n\nWe interviewed Faith Wallace to learn more about why she started the Archimedes Project and to invite her to share her firsthand experiences seeing the effects of cholera in Haiti.\n\n*What inspired you to form the Archimedes Project and combat cholera in Haiti? Can you share any anecdotes regarding the situation in Haiti you are trying to combat?*\n\nI was inspired in large part by the work I was already doing. I am a PhD candidate in molecular microbiology at Tufts Medical School studying cholera, and my research area has long been in diarrhea disease because it is a leading killer of children under the age of five. My work first centered on understanding the specific mechanisms that diarrhea-causing E. coli use to resist killing by antibiotics. My doctoral work focused on understanding the molecular basis of the rapid spread of cholera.\n\nIn October 2010, Haiti experienced a cholera outbreak. Within two weeks of the outbreak, I had established a collaboration with Saint Nicola Hospital in Saint Marc, the hospital at the epicenter of the outbreak, to collect patient samples. When I arrived in Haiti, I found a country still deeply scarred by the January 2010 earthquake: displaced people filled the squares and streets of Port-au-Prince. Destroyed buildings were everywhere. And people were dealing with a new horror: cholera.\n\nWhat I also found was commerce. I found men selling bottles of water and SIM cards in the street, women selling fruits in the markets, children in their uniforms going to school. I also found an international community completely incapable of coordinating the hundreds of foreign aid workers trying to stop the cholera outbreak.\n\n*Many attempts have been made to combat cholera in Haiti and they have been largely unsuccessful. Why do you think that is?*\n\nThe efforts to combat cholera in Haiti have been successful. The number of cases has been drastically reduced, as have the number of deaths. What they haven’t done is eliminate the disease from the country.\n\nOriginally, I started my graduate work in cholera molecular biology because I thought that a treatment or a vaccine could have the most positive impact. I went to Haiti and saw them try to fight the spread of cholera with the simplest intervention: the chlorine tablet. Seeing that effort fail showed me it is not about the intervention; it is about distribution. How do you get even the most basic technology to 10 million people?\n\nFrom then on I soaked myself in information about the most successful large-scale interventions in water. Water is a local issue in so many ways. It is also a regional and community issue. You can treat your water in your own house, but at the end of the day you and especially your children are going to get water somewhere other than your house, and when you do, if your neighbors and your neighbors’ neighbors aren't treating their water, you are at risk of infection.\n\nFor me, there was a disconnect: an international community unable to get chlorine tablets to every household and a populace not only wanting a solution but also eager to work. I realized people want to work, and people want water. People in Haiti pay for water, not only directly in cash, but also indirectly in time, lost work, missed school, poor health, and, when there is cholera, in death. I began to ask if it was possible to marry the need for work with the need for clean water.\n\n*How do you think technology can play a successful role in the response to cholera? Are there technologies you are eager to see deployed?*\n\nWhat became clear to me is that the programs that seem to work the best have an internally-driven component. The strongest motive is an economic motive. That’s what got me thinking, “Well, we have technologies that work and a need for profit in a place where the economy is suffering in part from this problem. Why not try to use technology both to protect people from this disease and to help them build a better economy?”\n\nThe technologies that interest me most are ones that are practical, scalable, and actually work. I did recently learn about electrochlorinators − systems that use an electric current to disinfect water − and am interested in including them in the project. They are low cost, simple to use, and easy to deploy in a big way. Paul Polak’s Spring Health has deployed them in India in an exciting way. In Haiti, one of our technology partners, Antenne, has an electrochlorinator called the WATA that has been deployed in Haiti. I'm interested to seeing if any of the teams pick up that technology in their plans.\n\n*Describe the Archimedes Project and your November kickoff event. How do you think this event can contribute to improving the situation in Haiti?*\n\nThe Archimedes Project will bring together 50 people from across business, non-profit, academic, and government sectors for a collaborative event that will design an actionable and scalable water or sanitation social business driven by local entrepreneurs. With the advice of the experts who understand water and sanitation, who understand Haiti, who understand business, these young professionals and students will come up with plans that could be launched in Haiti.\n\nWe will then actually launch them in collaboration with our partners. We are going to design a large-scale system over the course of the weekend. Over the following days, weeks and months, we will launch that program: first in one location, then across the country. The goal is to be on the ground, operating, finding out what works, adjusting the plan and scaling within one year.\n\n*What sort of projects or initiatives do you hope will emerge from the event?*\n\nThe goal of the Archimedes Project is to produce a large-scale clean water social enterprise in Haiti that uses low-energy technology. It will be a micro-enterprise or micro-franchise and piloted with an experienced on-the-ground partner. The nature of the plan will be determined by the groups and will depend on their ideas and experiences.\n\n*Are you currently partnering with any NGOs or government agencies in Haiti? What are the goals of these partnerships?*\n\nYes. We are very luck to have many Haitian partners. We have partners who work in water and sanitation and are acting as advisors to the project. These organizations have worked in the water or sanitation space in Haiti and have a deep knowledge of the topic. We are thrilled that two organizations − Safe Water Haiti and Pure Water for the World − are sending their directors to join us in November!\n\nWe are also partnering with organizations that have a strong and longstanding presence in a community. They will advise teams during the event and will support us as we pilot the plan that comes out of the Archimedes Project.\n\nAs for the goals of these partnerships, an important aspect of the Archimedes Project is the Lean Startup model of quickly implementing a plan in order to find out what works and what doesn't. It is our goal to get on the ground as quickly as possible and start finding out what elements we come up with in Boston will translate in Haiti and what won’t. From there we can iterate and scale.\n\nHaving partners all over the country will allow us to form nucleii from which we can build. We will be thinking globally but acting locally, recognizing that each region may have specific characteristics that we will have to be flexible enough to address. We are so excited to get started!\n\nHave an idea for the Archimedes Project? Want to participate? Tweet to them @ArchGrp to learn more and help share their story.\n"

Schumacher’s manifesto. While his appropriate technology movement has been eclipsed by a wave of social entrepreneurs who 'Design for Extreme Affordability', Schumacher's mantra is alive and well in Bogotá, Colombia. Located on a small farm tucked between the foothills of the Eastern Andes, Fundación Organizmo is a crucible where diverse methods in sustainable architecture blend with locally sourced and recycled materials to create housing that is as simple in engineering as it is elegant in design.\n\nAfter studying architecture at the Parson’s School of Design, Fundación Organizmo’s founder, Ana María Gutiérrez, recognized the barriers between the aspirations of ecologically conscious community developers and the skills required to build high-quality, safe and affordable housing. “People get really excited when they see pictures of superadobe houses online, so they watch a 15 minute video on YouTube and think that they can build their dream home, but it’s not that simple,” Gutierrez cautions, “that’s why we’ve created this space for the exchange of practical, hands-on knowledge in bio-construction.”\n\nOrganizmo was born out of impromptu amateur workshops in sustainable architecture techniques, led by Gutierrez on her family’s farm. Over the past four years, transient volunteers and apprentices have mastered skills in a variety of techniques - including plastic bottle houses, superadobe, geodesic domes, solar-dried bricks, and more - leaving behind an eclectic village in their wake, and introducing their newly learned skills to developing communities around the world.\n\n“Once we impart the fundamental principles of a given technique,” Gutierrez says, “apprentices can adapt architectural forms to the unique characteristics of their respective communities.” Indeed, one Organizmo fellow from the arid Guajira province of Northern Colombia, and another from the Amazon may both learn how to build a superadobe eco-dome in the mild highlands outside of Bogotá. Applying the same technique within different climatic and cultural contexts, however, produces two distinct solutions to the same fundamental problem: the lack of high-quality and eco-friendly housing.\n\nOrganizmo addresses this problem through regular workshops at its campus, and also by partnering with government agencies to bring sustainable housing directly to communities in need. But whether they are helping to build recreational spaces out of recycled materials in a peri-urban neighborhood, or blending new techniques in bio-construction with indigenous practices in the Amazon, Organizmo faces new challenges not experienced when working with like-minded individuals on their own turf.\n\n“We try to strike a balance in meeting the demands of municipal stakeholders, while also delivering culturally-relevant and acceptable habitat solutions,” says Gutierrez. This often takes time, with up to six months dedicated to raising awareness amongst community members, alone. But by nurturing associative, participatory and hands-on skills in bio-construction, Organizmo creates projects in social innovation that are wholly adopted and maintained by the communities they serve.\n\nThis type of behavior change is no easy feat, especially when considering that the material ambitions of impoverished Colombians are not so different from those of their middle and upper class counterparts. Organizmo’s answer is not to mollify these populations with the cheapest available solutions in adequate housing, but rather to enable communities to harness the fruits of local ecosystems, in order to create homes and public spaces that consistently grow and improve as communities prosper.\n"

Governments often turn to investment in chemicals and infrastructure as the obvious approach.  But at the grassroots level in Karnataka, India, it's all being accomplished with worms, women, a few low-cost tablets and cartloads of manure.\n\nJaya Organic Yojana (JOY) is not a business or an NGO, but rather a movement that leverages the collective power and networks of 300 Indian non-profits to restore soil fertility and provide business opportunities for thousands of impoverished villagers and farmers, just by switching to organic farming and composting.  At the core of JOY’s activity is a training program that teaches thousands of villagers (most of whom are women) how to create nutrient-rich fertilizer through vermiculture, a process of composting that uses live earthworms, manure and green waste.  Villagers can secure a livelihood by selling the fertilizer to farmers, who in turn benefit from organic farming practices.\n\nWhile ‘organic’ and ‘wealth’ have different connotations in developed countries (the latter often being a prerequisite to obtaining the former), according to JOY’s founder, Smita Shah, JOY is “not concerned with selling organic produce at high prices, but rather with making the soil healthy.”  Local farmers agree, and express eagerness to go organic. “Chemical farming is expensive,” explains Shah. \"It drains the farmer’s pocket as well as her land.  With the damage to the land, more and more additives are required to get a good harvest.”  \n\nShah has been a lot of things in her life - NYU film student, musician, activist, self-proclaimed hippie - but throughout her life she has been consistently inspired by the landscape of Southern India, a landscape now depleted from decades of exposure to chemical fertilizers.  JOY is the culmination of Shah’s work to address problems of drought and soil degradation head-on, while also boosting prosperity and nutrition for the region’s population. “We are painting the landscape”, Shah says.  \"It's a work of art and when we are done the Karnataka belt will become organic, and chemical free!”\n\nAssisted by microloans, villagers pay Rs 11,000 (USD $177) to participate in JOY’s six-month training program.  The program includes a toolkit for three composting beds with live earthworms, and extensive on-site training seminars that use low-cost tablet computers to show instructional videos and collect data remotely.  The remaining supplies are easy to come by, says Shah, “waste material that would otherwise be burnt is converted into life-giving compost.” And the payoff is sweet: for villagers, Rs 22,500 (USD $362) every sixty days from selling compost and surplus earthworms to farmers; for farmers, a sustainable alternative to costly chemical fertilizers; for the region, reasonably priced organic produce and a fertile landscape.\n\nVermiculture, popularized in India over the past forty years by Dr. Radha Kale, is a newcomer to the subcontinent’s 10,0000+ year-old agricultural scene.  To disrupt the status quo, JOY operates like an agile startup, blending traditional, village-based networking and canvassing with mobile communication, cloud computing and even viral marketing.  Having mapped out hundreds of villages across Karnataka, JOY representatives have already begun training village organizers, who in turn recruit and train locals for the vermicompost program.  Participants sign up on tablets, and all data is then uploaded to the cloud at wifi hotspots.  To reach prospective participants, JOY operates in partnership with Sumangali Seva Ashrama, a vast network of 300 NGOs operating throughout 8,000 villages.  With support from this network, and an endorsement from its decorated founder, S.G. Susheelama, JOY’s brand carries serious clout.\n\nStill, some additional advertising doesn’t hurt. “We are also creating branded products - t-shirts, backpacks, caps, coffee mugs - and as if that weren’t enough,” adds Shah, “we are also getting Hamsalekha, a famous film composer, to create our homemade Field Workers song, and a choreographer from the Kannada film industry to work with these same field workers to create a music video.”  The ultimate goal? “To train 10,080 people this year, and 200,000 rural people at the bottom of the pyramid in the next ten years.”\n\nWith a strong viral coefficient, JOY’s potential for socioeconomic as well as environmental impact in India is enormous.  “What [JOY] is doing will mitigate urban migration,” Shah claims. “It gives youth a reason and a livelihood to remain in the countryside, it reverses damage.” This prospect has caught the attention of the public sector, with up to USD $1,000,000 in grants and loans in the pipeline from the Indian government.\nGiven its nascent stage, skeptics may dismiss the vision of Jaya Organic Yojana as overly idealistic.  But the ambitious movement is based on proven methodologies and rigorous data collection, and ample support at the community and government levels further bolsters JOY’s prospects for success.  JOY is also certain to be propelled in the longer term by India’s burgeoning demand for organic foods, Smita Shah’s delightful quip notwithstanding: “May ‘certification’ rest in glory, and the soil live on!”\n"

While the documentary also offers examples of how connectivity can chip away at core values such as community and friendship, Information & Communication Technologies (ICTs) hold promise to reduce poverty, increase productivity and boost economic growth while improving accountability and governance. Last mile communities with ICT infrastructure do far more than chat and play online games. They learn where it is best to fish and at which markets to sell their products. They trace cattle from pastures to supermarkets. They pay bills, send remittances and receive cash transfers. They do business on mobile phones.  They utilize the tools in ways that better their lives and increase productivity.\n\nIndeed, strong demand for increased connectivity in communities like Palestina is driving governments, NGOs and the private sector to deliver sustainable solutions.  Globally there are four billion people not yet using the Internet, 90% of whom live in developing countries. Internet penetration rates have reached 70% in developed countries, but lag at 32% in developing countries. In Peru 64% of rural villages have access to mobile phones while only 11.9% have access to internet.  But isolated communities exhibit a perfect storm of complex characteristics that make the successful introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) a huge challenge. Among these obstacles are high geographic dispersion, lack of electricity and infrastructure, high levels of poverty and illiteracy, and small populations.  Combined, these challenges have historically repelled private sector telcos and stymied government intervention.  \n\nIn Peru, however, the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunication is funding projects in collaboration with a coalition of NGOs and private telcos to make remote connectivity a reality.  Among them is GTR-PUCP or ‘The Rural Telecommunications Research Group’, a Peruvian organization focused on the development and promotion of rural telecommunications in Latin America.  In conversations with TEL, GTR-PUCP co-founder Luis Camacho pointed to two key factors in tackling problems of remote connectivity: orgware and well-trained personnel.  While solid orgware requires community leaders and decision makers to welcome and support development projects, for any project to be sustainable in the long term it is also necessary to ensure that community members are trained in the capacity to maintain hardware and systems. Citing connectivity projects in the Peruvian Amazon begun over seven years ago, for which local communities still count on his team for maintenance support, Camacho underscored problems of programmatic sustainability when such dependence is a factor.\n\nBased on his time spent in Palestina, Michael Kleiman is inclined to agree.  While he notes the enthusiasm with which villagers embraced the arrival of phone and internet access, Kleiman's work conveys the frustration of community leaders in Palestina who were unequipped to perform routine maintenance on routers and laptops.  Camacho suggests that failed outcomes can be averted by not only providing improved training and capacitation programs to community stakeholders, but also by utilizing simpler yet equally robust communication technologies. GTR PUCP points to wireless alternatives that are both cost-effective and easy to install compared to wired solutions, including Wi-Fi, VHF (Very High Frequency) and HF (High Frequency) radio communications, WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), and VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminals) satellite communication. No matter the technology, a renewable energy source and a well-established evaluation and monitoring system are essential for rural connectivity to succeed.\n\nAlthough Palestina has enjoyed renewed - even if sporadic - internet connectivity since initial implementation, ‘Wiring the Amazon’ ends with scenes of broken student laptops from the One Laptop Per Child program (OLPC).  “Dump hardware in schools, hope for magic to happen.”  So goes a ‘worst practice’ for ICT in education, as expressed by Michal Trucano, ICT & Education Specialist with the World Bank.  While Trucano indicates that the Peruvian government’s intent was to “combine the provision of laptops with a pedagogical model targeted toward increased achievement by students,” the program’s rollout was plagued by insufficient educational content, teacher training and - especially in the case of rural communities - technological maintenance and upkeep.\n"

She's thinking about how to cook dinner in a Haitian slum. Most of Haiti has been deforested, few people have electricity, and fossil fuels are prohibitively expensive. But there's something Haiti has a lot of: bagasse, or sugar-cane fibers left over after processing. Smith and her students have developed a way to turn this plentiful (and otherwise useless) material into clean-burning charcoal by carbonizing it in a covered oil drum. It's a simple solution to a simple problem, but—like many of Smith's projects—it makes a big difference in ordinary people's lives.\n\nSmith, a practitioner of humanitarian engineering, wants to solve everyday problems for rural families in the developing world: where to find clean water, how to preserve vegetables for market, how to do laundry without electricity or plumbing. Smith's inventions include a hammer mill for grinding grain into flour—a task African women usually do by hand—and a portable kit to test drinking water for contaminating bacteria. Smith, who was awarded a Macarthur Fellowship in 2004, runs MIT's IDEAS Competition, for which teams of student engineers design projects to make life easier in the developing world.\n\n*What would you say was the coolest project that you've worked on?*\n\nWell, it's not very romantic, but I think our charcoal project is going to have a huge impact, because it allows you to have a clean-burning fuel without cutting down trees. We're planning large-scale dissemination in Haiti. There's no glitz factor to it, but it's probably going to make a huge amount of difference.\n\n*Have the inventions that come out of your class and out of the IDEAS competition proved successful in the field?*\n\nSome of the IDEAS competition winners have been very successful. The compound water filter, which removes arsenic and pathogens, is now deployed quite extensively in Nepal. The Kinkajou microfilm projector, used in nighttime literacy classes, is being deployed in Mali. We’re working to commercialize a system for testing water for potability. It's in the field in several countries, but not on a widespread basis. We're looking towards doing a trial of aerosol vaccines in Pakistan, so that's exciting.\n\n*What is the biggest problem facing rural communities in the developing world?*\n\nI don't think you can say there's a single one. Obviously access to safe drinking water is a huge problem, and lack of access to opportunities, and general poverty. But if you get people safe drinking water, and then they still have no way to earn any money to feed their families, you still have a problem. And if you give them better methods of agricultural processing or ways to create clean energy, but there's still drinking water that makes them sick, you still have a problem. There are too many interrelated issues, so solving one problem won't completely change the lives of millions.\n\n*You lived in India as a child and you were in the Peace Corps in Botswana in the 1980s. How did those experiences lead to what you're doing now?*\n\nAs a very young child I was exposed to very severe poverty, so I always wanted to do something to help kids around the world. Living in India is something that stayed with me—I could put faces on the kids who had so little money. In Botswana, I was teaching and then working for the ministry of agriculture as a beekeeper, and I remember thinking to myself that I really liked doing development work, but I wished could do some engineering too, because I like creative problem solving. People in the developing world scrape every last ounce of life that they can out of objects, and my students used to bring me things to fix, and I always enjoyed being able to do that.\n\n*You’ve said that engineering schools focus too much on defense and consumer electronics—what changes would you like to see in the way engineering is taught?*\n\nAdvertisementIt would be great if students recognized that engineering with a humanitarian focus is as legitimate as aerospace and automotive engineering. Service learning is actually a very good way to teach engineering, because it motivates students to continue, and it appeals especially to women and minorities.\n\n*You are a woman in what is still a male-dominated field. What can we do to encourage more women to become engineers?*\n\nActually, because my class involves humanitarian engineering, I very rarely have more men than women. There have been times where there have been ten women and one man. This isn't surprising, given that women often want to see an application to what they're learning that they feel is worthwhile. But I'm not involved in any particular projects to encourage women engineers, because I dislike being referred to as a woman engineer. I don't like programs that single out woman engineers as particular achievers just for being women. I think that it should be coincidental. What we should be striving for is a world where when we see women or minorities who are high achievers, it isn't surprising. We shouldn't be thinking, \"Good for them!\" just because of their race or gender. I think we're a long, long way from that, but I don't think we should keep implying that there's something special about being a woman engineer. I want people who meet me to say, \"I like the work that you're doing.\" I want to be known as an engineer who designs solutions for the developing world. After that people can notice that I'm a woman.\n"

I remember being filled with so much excitement after scanning through, and then going ahead to take a detailed look at the TEL website! It was exciting to me because up until then I had never seen such a huge compendium of resources available for use in low-resource centers such as where I grew up and attended school. The constraints faced in developing countries are hardly imaginable if you haven't lived and worked in the settings. Imagine my great joy as I browsed through the TEL website and saw innovative tools such as solar powered autoclave machines, LED lights operating without a plug, clean water solutions, and numerous other products that met vital needs. My greatest excitement was the realization, through TEL, that technology is being produced that works around a lot of the complexities faced in Africa and other developing countries. All in one location!\n\nAs a physician trained and practicing in Nigeria, the discovery of such as useful resource is humbling. For me, it not only serves the purpose of presenting simple solutions to gigantic problems I face on a daily basis in practice; it also serves to provide links to solution providers and the opportunity for problems to meet their solutions! For me, TEL is an excellent platform for solution makers and solution seekers to interact, and through this 'little step' of connecting, step by step, we can make a difference at every level. Great job, TEL!\n\nBetsy Teutsch, author of 100 Under $100: the Women’s Global Toolkit\n\nA few months ago, Dana Raviv over at Catchafire told me about Technology Exchange Lab, a group creating a developing world technology catalog, a bit like my book project. First I freaked out. Then I got excited. There are a billion women who need improved technology, and here’s a chance to collaborate. How wonderful the TEL folks feel just the same way. Thanks, Dana!\n\nBack in the day working for GreenMicrofinance, I learned about energy and sanitation poverty, and was impressed by the ingenious, eco-smart solutions helping to eradicate these immense drags on women’s productivity. Recently I joined Dining For Women, a growing network of over 350 local Giving Circles which together support women’s global empowerment. Focusing on girls’ and women’s legal, educational, health, and discrimination problems is super important, but I kept thinking: something very basic is missing. Technology.\n\nThe tech world is buzzing with appropriate, entry-level developing world offerings, but – as in the developed world – the tech sector is male-dominated. Women are rarely included in technology design and application. One notable exception is Dr. Pilar Mateo, a Spanish chemist and humanitarian, inventor of an insecticide-infused paint that repels the vampire-like insects that spread Chagas disease. Why do more people not know of her breakthrough work? Making sure people do is the goal of 100 Under $100, a catalog of 100 products and practices under $100 that will specifically help women climb the ladder out of extreme poverty, together\n\nOne of the solutions in TEL’s database is the LifePlayer, the first MP3-enabled multi-band radio designed and engineered for the humanitarian sector. It has the potential to change the rhythms of women’s daily lives. I quite agree with Tom Hanks, LifePlayer’s ambassador, – we can’t envision all the ways the LifePlayer will spark creativity. Using its recording capacity, imagine how exciting it will be for women to hear their own voices and broadcast their own truths!  \n\nWe all love a good story. The soap operas so beloved by past generations have proven to be an excellent format for disseminating public health information. Women working together, while they listen to the daily installment – they are the ones that will fight for clean water and schooling for their daughters. And when they hear about Pilar Mateo on their LifePlayer they will want that magic paint. Next thing, they’ll be lobbying for a paint factory in their country, and the next thing after that, they’ll be selling and applying the paint. I can’t wait!\n"

In 2011, Datawind formed a high-profile partnership with the Indian government to distribute their touted Aakash Tablet, now called “the cheapest tablet in the world.”  \n\nDatawind is the manufacturer of two products already featured in TEL’s database of solutions aimed at closing gaps in education and information technology: the UbiSlate7Ci Tablet; and the UbiSlate7C+ Tablet/ Smartphone. We were fortunate to be able to interview Suneet Singh Tuli, CEO of Datawind, catching him “on the fly” via Skype on his flight to London.\n\n*What inspired the creation of Datawind, and your mission of connecting the developing world to the internet?*\n\nOriginally, Datawind was started because we had ideas on how to provide internet access in developing countries’ networks.  \n\nFor me, at a personal level, it was about bridging the “digital divide,” which has always been a passion. I left India at the age of 8, and I didn’t have a sense of what the divisions in social classes [in Indian society] were. I realized, while growing up in Canada, that people in lower social classes would not have the same education as me.  \n\nI wanted to use technology to bridge the digital divide. You don’t need a lot of infrastructure — it is already present in India. You don’t need a lot of bandwidth. You can offer free mobile internet in [Indian] markets.  \n\n*What is your business model? How do you distribute Datawind products in the countries where you work? How does Datawind find and choose recipients and customers of their products? How do you instruct new users?*\n\nWe’re big believers that a sense of affordability is key. We strive to continue to lower the costs of hardware. We do sell products to governments, and we encourage them to use technology to improve the quality of education, but we also sell to consumers in these markets.  \n\nWe encourage governments to help us deliver better quality education. We also sell directly to consumers through cellular phone distribution channels. In any of these places where people sell cell phones, by getting the price point down 50 points or lower, we can sell in places where people would already sell cell phones, whereas computers would cost more. We can get a broader reach by doing that.  \n\nIn most countries, we first go in and pitch to the local government and advertise to them the benefits of using this technology in this manner. We then do it commercially. We advertise and offer products online.  We either let [consumers] come to us or use the local government to find a channel to carry our products.  \n\nWe don’t do a lot of consumer or end user training. With education, we do a lot of training to show how to integrate [Datawind products] into the curriculum. We find the interface to be so user friendly that that new users can pick up on it by playing around. The graphic arts allow for a short learning curve.  \n\n*Do you partner with any other companies or organizations?*\n\nWe do end up donating and helping pilot projects in the field. We try to partner with content developers and providers that focus around education. We do a lot of work with NGOs working on women's empowerment or training entrepreneurs.  An example would be appstoempower.org, an effort to get people developing apps for the social good. At least a billion more people will be on the internet in the next three years as the cost lowers. These apps help the overall social good.  \n\n*How did the Indian government come to recognize the potential of your Aakash tablet? What impact do you feel your products have had in India?*\n\nAfter a lot of effort and about 10 years of presentations, including the efforts of One Laptop Per Child, the government began to see these technologies as crucial to making improvements in the education of the children of India.  \n\nI thinks it’s early to measure our impact on education and people’s lives, but certainly we’ve seen the cost of computers in the market drop. Certainly the impact has been affordability and increased demand because of affordable prices.  \n\nI’m very confident it will help empower people in many ways, empowering people with that kind of access to the best quality education, the type that anyone has available around the world.  \n\n*Do you have any favorite anecdotes about the difference your tablet or another product has made in the developing world?*\n\nThere are stories of how we see NGOs deploy and sell [our products]. One of the NGOs mentors women entrepreneurs, but the challenge is, with that mission, how do you reach out and mentor? So they are using Skype and apps on our products to mentor.  \n\nWhat’s interesting is that if they are tablets, you start to see multiple units in the family using them. I often get asked the question, What is the right age to get started? Is there an age too young? I see them often used as pacifiers. We are going to see children growing up with access using them at a very early age.\n\nLearn more about the Datawind tablets [here](http://technologyexchangelab.org/find-solutions/search-results/?search=1&keywords=&org=DataWind+Ltd&ta=).\n"

With little expertise in water and sanitation solutions, COMIN-SL is further challenged by a lack of financial resources, and logistical obstacles that prevent them from importing pre-manufactured water and sanitation solutions into Sierra Leone.\n\n## TEL’s Role\n\nAfter working with COMIN-SL to identify the major issues faced by community members in relation to their water and sanitation needs, TEL introduced COMIN-SL to a variety of ‘Do-It-Yourself’ solutions that can be locally manufactured to provide clean drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities. Once COMIN-SL selected the solutions that best respond to their stakeholders’ needs and desires, TEL provided the organizations with detailed design specifications for the local manufacture of simple, robust water and sanitation technologies.\n\n## Results\n\nCOMIN-SL selected the Tippy-Tap hand washing system and the Biosand water filter as two locally-implementable solutions to pilot within local schools, markets and community centers. TEL is providing additional support by connecting COMIN-SL with a nonprofit organization that specializes in the knowledge transfer of best practices in Biosand filter manufacture. Once COMIN-SL has conducted an impact assessment of the Tippy-Tap pilot project, TEL will explore funding opportunities to scale up successful projects.\n"

This helps in reducing household pollution and related diseases, thus improving health outcomes for women and children in developing countries. Moreover, use of the ACE 1 over open-fire cooking drastically reduces the risk of house fires.\n\nA fan blows oxygen into the ACE 1 chamber through holes at both the bottom and the top. This drives the fire to increase in temperature until it reaches approximately 1000°C. These conditions cause the biomass to gasify. Then the hot gas floats up to the top, meeting more oxygen and combusting completely. \n\nThe stove will produce as much as 5kW worth of energy. When fully charged, the battery will power the fan for over 20 hours of cooking. The battery can also be used to charge a mobile device or run LED lighting, and can be boosted using a solar panel.\n\nFuel Consumption:\nFull fan: 750 grams (8mm pellet) in 50 minutes.\nLow fan: 750 grams (8mm pellet) in 100 minutes.\n\nCharging time:\n3 hours of cooking ≈ 1 hour of charging\nSolar panel charging time may vary according to exposure to sunlight\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nAfrican Clean Energy has been founded to provide smokeless and sustainable cookstoves for anyone, anywhere. Initially with a focus on local supply around South Africa they are currently expanding beyond this region with the introduction of online ordering.\n\nThe Cookstove is sent via a flatpack shipping option, which means the stoves can be sent in parts, saving substantially on logistics costs.

Each unit of the prototype comes with the following features:- Two adjustable 40 watt solar panels (collapsible for storage)- Charging space for 16 phones of all major brands- Display tray that folds vertically to secure charging phones- Powerful battery to store energy collected throughout the day- Manual crank to charge battery at night or on cloudy days- Two mountain bike tires to transport over rough dirt roads- AC power outlets to charge other appliances\n\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIt all started when inventor Henri took a trip to Burundi. It became almost impossible to find a reliable way to charge his cell phone, but after a few days he was back home and the minor inconvenience had passed. It dawned on him a week later that, while I had the luxury of returning home to a stable electrical grid, the people of Burundi lived each and every day without that service. What presented an inconvenience for him presented an insurmountable roadblock to consistent communication outside of Burundian’s neighborhood.\n\nIn 2009 Henri paired up with a designer to fill that vital gap in energy availability. Together they came up with a blueprint that would offer the operator mobility, dependability, simplicity, and—most importantly—a low-cost means for him or her to generate an income. In 2010 Henri found an engineer to help me bring this idea to life. And so the Mobile Charging Kiosk (MKP) was born. \nThe device is a franchise business model, so we partner with local franchisee that supply our products and services to the end users at the base of the pyramid. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Burundi, Rwanda  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: no  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 6 feet  \nWeight: 40 pound  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://a-r-e-d.com)  \n[Product page](http://a-r-e-d.com)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.a-r-e-d.com/media/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: African Renewable Energy Distributor\n\nHenri Nyakarundi  \nAfrican Renewable Energy Distributor  \nKigali  \nRwanda  \n250787666436  \n[henri@a-r-e-d.com](mailto:henri@a-r-e-d.com)  \n\n\n"

Too many agricultural workers, from Egypt to Mexico, were unable to purchase reasonable meals from the profits of their labor during this price volatility. But the world changes quickly. Communications prices are falling and a coffee grower with a small plot of land in Ethiopia can now market his crop internationally to wherever it's most in demand. Factories can work out global supply chains to find competitive inputs, keeping prices low for consumers. Traders can find safe products from areas of the world they never had access to until recently.\n\nAgroam simply packages this together in an easy to use platform.

AguaClara technologies are built entirely out of inexpensive locally-available materials.  They do not require highly-skilled labor to operate, and they run without any electricity. \n\nThe facilities use state-of-the-art chemical dosing that eliminates failures due to software, electronics, pumps and computers. Widely available, either aluminum sulfate or poly-aluminum chloride is used as the coagulant. Coagulant aids are not needed because the AguaClara design, based on computational fluid dynamics analysis, eliminates floc break up. The open design with no enclosed tanks reduces construction costs, simplifies maintenance and provides feedback to the operator for optimal plant performance. \n\nThe AguaClara Stacked Rapid Sand Filter operates without a filtered water storage tank or backwash pumps. The advanced filter fluidics control system eliminates the need for large control valves, pneumatics and electronics. Water is disinfected with liquid chlorine to kill any remaining pathogens. The total system operating cost is approximately $3 per household per month. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nCentralized drinking water treatment is often unsustainable for rural communities because conventional technology often cannot be sustained in a resource-poor context. The result has been to focus on point-of-use systems, which fall short of providing the necessary utilities for complete sanitation and hygiene. By re-engineering conventional treatment technologies for the small-scale, communities may receive clean drinking water right at the tap. This means individuals can cook, clean, bathe and wash dishes with clean water, thus minimizing contamination pathways and preventing fatal diseases and frequent illnesses.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Honduras, India  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.aguaclarallc.com)  \n[Product page](http://www.aguaclarallc.com)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: AguaClara\n\nMaysoon  Sharif  \nAguaClara  \nWashington D.C.  \n20001  \nUnited States  \n[info@aguaclara.cc](mailto:info@aguaclara.cc)  \n\n\n"

The Golden Minute identifies the steps that a birth attendant must take immediately after birth to evaluate the baby and stimulate breathing.\n\nThe HBB curriculum is designed to be used as part of a coordinated educational approach to early neonatal care and can be effectively combined with other curricula. It can be locally taught to birth attendants in diverse venues and locations. HBB focuses on practices that all persons who care for babies at birth can learn to care for healthy babies and/or assist babies who do not breathe on their own.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe WHO estimates that one million babies die each year from birth asphyxia (eg. inability to breathe immediately after delivery).

The only penalty is the need to have a safe and secure mounting in as exposed a location as possible\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nSince 1973 Ampair wind turbines have been manufactured in the UK for use in extreme conditions worldwide. Several years later the Aquair hybrid wind and water turbines were introduced, followed soon after by the Aquair UW micro hydro generator (now just called the Underwater). The business was initially started in 1972 in Guildford and soon moved down to Poole in Dorset.\n\nIn 2000 the Ampair business was taken over by Doughty Engineering Ltd and production moved from Poole to Ringwood. In late 2005 ownership transferred to Boost Energy Systems Ltd at which point production moved to Warfield in Berkshire. Boost have been active in manufacturing distributed power systems in the UK since 1957, concentrating on the 1kW to 50kW market.\n\nThis was a friendly acquisition and we have been able to relocate most of the staff to the main manufacturing premises in Berkshire, or make arrangements for them to continue on an outsourced basis. Most of the supply base has been unaffected and indeed Doughty continue to act as one of the Ampair foundries. AmpairR and AquairR remain the main brand names of Ampair, and are joined by PowerFurlTM.\n\nAt Ampair we believe that sustainable societies can only be built with integrated mixed economies based upon a variety of energy sources with a long term future. For this reason we continue to invest in our UK manufacturing operations and are actively seeking to develop our renewable and distributed energy business.\n\nIn 2010 Ampair Energy Limited purchased the business and assets of Boost Energy Systems Limited. At the same time the venture capital group Sigma Capital Group plc has committed £1.5m to the business.

PAYG allows Angaza to sell high-quality alternative energy products, like the SoLite, for a low, affordable upfront price. Customers then pay the remainder of the unit price in small increments over time by pre-paying for their energy use. To do this, they simply send Angaza a micropayment of the size of their choice using a phone-based mobile money service, such as Safaricom M-PESA.  Angaza receives the payment and initiates a call to the customer’s phone. They answer that call and hold their phone near the SoLite.  Angaza uses the open audio channel to securely communicate the customer’s payment to their product. By using audio communication to leverage the customer’s existing phone hardware, Angaza can embed its technology in solar products at minimal additional cost. The Angaza PAYG hardware then tracks how much energy the customer consumes, and after the pre-paid energy is used, output shuts off until the next payment is made. Payments are rent-to-own, and the SoLite unlocks permanently when the full price has been reached.

Beneath each of the ten holes, saliva samples are presented for odor discrimination by rats. The lids are uncovered one-by-one and the animals sniff hole-per-hole for positive targets. Every hole is equipped with a laser beam, broken by the nose of the rat. A rat only needs a few hundredths of a second to discriminate the target odor. In case of a negative sample the rat immediately moves on to the next sample. Positive samples are indicated by keeping their nose fixed in the sniffer hole for at least three seconds, which is registered in a database.\n\nKnown positives are inserted to allow reinforcement of indication behavior. At three seconds indication of known positive samples, the animals hear a click sound and they receive a food reward. Rat-detected suspect samples are re-tested for the presence of TB using concentrated smear and LED microscopy.\n \nThe rats evaluate 100 saliva samples within 20 minutes, which would take a lab technician more than two days using microscopy. So far more than 5,800 TB patients who were initially missed by means of microscopy have been positively diagnosed, thus preventing 87,000 potential infections. \n\nAPOPO has managed to increase the TB case detection rate by an average of 40%.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThere are approximately 8.5 million new cases of TB per-year and 1.3 million people died from TB in 2012.

Therefore a fast and accurate diagnostic technology is needed. \n\nIn many developing countries, TB is still detected through microscopy. The method can be precise but it is also slow, and between 20-80 % of positive cases can be missed. \"Detection Rats Technology\" frees low-income countries of their dependence on the expensive and often unavailable TB diagnostics as it is a fast, accurate and cost-effective screening tool. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Tanzania, Mozambique   \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.apopo.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.apopo.org/en/tuberculosis-detection/about)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: APOPO\n\nAPOPO  \nMorogoro  \nTanzania  \n+255 23 2600 635  \n[apopo@apopo.org](mailto:apopo@apopo.org)  \n\n\n"

The charcoal in the fridge rejects ethanol vapor when the steel box becomes hot, which flows into the condenser. \n\nThe condenser is made up of a series of pipes with cooling fins, where the ethanol vapor condenses into a liquid by reducing the temperature to the ambient air temperature. The evaporator, located inside the insulated box, captures the liquid which results in liquid ethanol in the evaporator and cool charcoal in the absorber. \n\nThe ethanol that is not absorbed back into the charcoal becomes very cold and results in the cold temperature inside the box, usually -10C to 0C degrees. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThis product is open source and can be built using locally available materials\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Free  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://apptechdesign.org)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://aidg.org/blog/?p=1446)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: The Appropriate Technology Collaborative\n\nJohn  Barrie  \nThe Appropriate Technology Collaborative  \nAnn Arbor, MI  \n48108  \nUnited States  \n734 668 4811  \n[john@apptechdesign.org](mailto:john@apptechdesign.org)  \n\n\n"

Polyethylene bags which contain filtered water produce ice blocks through the energy of the currant. Garman river turbines (or the very similar Tyson- and VHL-turbines) are well known technologies. Their typical power output is 300 – 500 W and they are mainly used for house lightning, cellphone recharging, etc. In contrast to the conventional turbines, the River Ice turbine is connected directly to a mechanical compressor, which cools down through polyethylene bags containing water, thus producing ice blocks.\n\nFor this system to work, a river must have a minimum depth of 1.7m and a flow rate of at least 0.6 m/sec. If the energy flow of a river surpasses 12 kWh/day, it is sufficient to produce more than 250 kg/24 h of ice in tropical areas with temperatures of 30ºC or higher. According to Aprotec, the River Ice plant allows a direct cost saving of about 66%, compared to usual ice production methods.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Columbia  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.aprotec.com.co)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.empowering-people-award.siemens-stiftung.org/en/shortlist/projects/river-ice-cooling-system/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: APROTEC\n\nAPROTEC  \nCali  \nColumbia  \n+57 (2) 6535797  \n[info@aprotec.com.co ](mailto:info@aprotec.com.co )  \n\n\n"

The foil tank is placed in the ground and used to collect/capture up to 50 cubic meters of rainwater. From there the water is pumped up, purified when needed and distributed as drinking water to the consumers. Collected water can be stored for a period of up to 8 months dependant on level of maintenance.\n\nThe RainCap system is easy to transport, install and maintain. It can be installed in combination with the UV WaterBox. The tank can be cleaned regularly and removed when needed. The RainCAP system has a lifetime of ten years or more.\n\nTarget group and delivery:\nThe RainCAP is designed for usage in tropical countries with modest to high rainfall. Sizes are family level (with a 15 m3 tank) and village level (a 50 m3 tank). The tanks follow a modular design and can be linked dependent on the needs of the client. The 15 m3 tank serves an extended family of 30 people for 8 months consuming 2 liters per person per day. The 50 m3 tank serves a village of 200 people drinking 2 liters per person per day for 4 month.\n\nRainwater Catchment area:\nCapturing of rainwater is best done using existing roof systems. Schools, medical centers and governmental buildings can be often deployed for that purpose. By installing rainwater gutters along the roofs the water is collected. The RainCAP system is attached at that point to take care of the filtering, storage and purification of the water. The total of the collected rainfall is dependent on the condition of the roofs, the gutters and the level op maintenance in combination with the local rainfall pattern.\n\nLimitations:\nThe RainCAP system is best applied in tropical regions displaying moderate to high rainfall. The systems can be installed in relative soft ground (compacted sand, silts, etc.). It is advised to avoid sharp rocks surfaces in order to prevent puncturing of the foil material.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 15 or 50 cubic meter tanks available  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.orangewaterfoundation.nl)  \n[Product page](http://www.aaws.nl/index.php/products/rain-water-harvesting)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.aaws.nl/images/stories/bestanden_aaws/brochure_rainCAP_mail.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Aqua-Aero WaterSystems BV\n\nAqua-Aero WaterSystems BV  \nCG Delft  \n2611  \nNetherlands  \n31 15 212 96 13  \n[info@aaws.nl](mailto:info@aaws.nl)  \n\n\n"

The backpack is a balloon of flexible, gas tight material equipped with backpack straps for body transport & a ball valve for fill-up & emptying. By directly connecting it to a biogas digester it is inflated with biogas & by weighting it down with an external weight: enough pressure & flow can be provided to supply a biogas stove or lamp for cooking & lighting.The pillow shaped pack have better characteristics in terms of providing constant gas pressure when weight down. In a fully inflated state the pack holds 1.2 m³ of biogas & weights 4.4 kg. It persist 0.53 bar inner pressure & 30,000 daN external pressure. The chosen material allows carbon dioxide (CO2) to transmit at a rate of about 840 ccm m-² d1, while methane is stored due to the low transmission rate of 200 ccm m-² d1. \nThe biogas backpack provides the opportunity to produce biogas in one central, technically more advanced biogas plant rather than in many individual small-scale, low productive digesters that is commonly used in developing countries. Installation, operation & maintenance are done by the owner of the biogas business. Surrounding farmers can contribute to the biogas production by selling substrate to the plant owner. In return they can buy biogas & fertiliser with an affordable price & convenience.  These create an income opportunities & can be the motor for further independent development & improve living conditions of poor rural households.\n\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Ethiopia, Kenya, Congo  \nPrice range (USD): 20 to 50 USD  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nWeight: 4.4 kg (in a fully inflated state)  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.be-nrg.com/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: (B) energy\n\nKatrin Puetz  \n(B) energy  \nAddis Ababa  \nEthiopia  \n[k.puetz@uni-hohenheim.de](mailto:k.puetz@uni-hohenheim.de)  \n\n\n"

Since bamboo is grown locally in Africa, and the manufacturing of bamboo bicycle frames does not require extensive infrastructure (or even electricity), bamboo bicycles have the potential to be a sustainable business that provides local employment even in areas disconnected from power and other facilities. If power and modern tools are available, the production of bamboo bicycles can increase. Bicycle design could easily evolve through local innovations and a variety of bicycles could be designed for different terrains and purposes. As the local people gain skills in building bamboo bicycles, they will have acquired translatable skills for building other types of vehicles.\n\nThe objectives of this project are two-fold:\n1. To build a better bike for poor Africans in rural areas.\n2. To stimulate a bicycle building industry in Africa to satisfy local needs.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Ghana  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.bamboobike.org/Home.html)  \n[Product page](http://www.bamboobike.org/Background.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Bamboo Bike Project\n\nJohn Mutter  \nBamboo Bike Project  \nPalisades, NY  \n10964  \nUnited States  \n[john@bamboobike.org](mailto:john@bamboobike.org)  \n\n\n"

The treatment model utilizes socio-economic and community orientated solutions to create changes in policy, practice and resource allocation.\n\nThe BasicNeeds model uses local resources to reduce symptoms in order to help people become active participants in their community.

The water bag features large built-in handles that facilitate both handling and transportation, as well as a quick-fill intake that allows end users to source untreated water quickly and easily. \n\nThe detachable filter unit is easy to clean - requiring only occasional back-flushing with clean water - and has a long service life compared to other solutions, since particles in the untreated water will settle below the water bag’s filter inlet in order to prevent filter clogging.

Just the right amount of insecticide migrates to the surface over the product's entire lifespan. As a result, Duranets do not need to be retreated with insecticide like traditional surface treated polyester nets. With insecticide incorporated into the net fibers instead of on the surface, Duranet allows for the safe transport and handling of large quantities of nets.\n\nCompared to traditional mosquito nets, Duranets are slightly rigid, which allows for increased air flow through the nets. As a result, users remain cool while they sleep. Duranet LLINs are available in a variety of colors, including dark colors, which do not need to be washed as frequently as white nets.

This product offers reverse current protection. The SolarRoll is designed to operate in a temperture range of -22°F to +122°F (-30°C to +50°C)\n\nThe SolarRoll consists of photovoltaic cells and will produce power when any of these segments are exposed to sunlight. This means that you can partially unroll the panel and still utilize the power provided. Each segment produces an average of 50mA. To calculate the amount of power your panel will produce when partially unrolled, count the number of segments that you have rolled out and then multiply by 50mA. The voltage stays the same when rolled out entirely or partially.\n\nFully extended, the SolarRolls produce 900mA, 600mA, or 300mA, depending on wich SolarRoll you own. They can also be linked to other SolarRolls of the same wattage to double the current output. Due to the amount of current present, we recommend that no more than three panels be put in a series at one time. \n\nThe SolarRoll is waterproof and can be submerged all the way up to the electrical connectors and not be damaged. Avoid getting the electrical outlets wet. This could cause a direct short of the panel and may permanently damage your product. Use caution when using any electrical appliance.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nOur drive and desire to pioneer a line of rugged power sources led to the introduction of the first flexible solar panel, the SolarRoll. Since then, the evolution of this concept has flourished. Backed by glowing reviews in every major magazine and newspaper in this country and others, the SolarRoll has officially taken its place as one of our most talked about products. The proof, though, is in the remarkable performance. The waterproof SolarRoll has given sea kayakers the power to photograph their voyages from the far reaches of the planet. And next spring, it will assist Ed Viesturs in his final summit, Annapurna, as he polishes off the last peak of Endeavor 8000. Ideal for powering satellite phones, members of expeditions worldwide pack the SolarRoll in place of expensive extra batteries that don't offer much relief in the form of weight. We realize however, that not everyone is defying the ordinary. Some of us simply need the SolarRoll for charging our car battery or running our video camera. With this in mind, we're offering alternative sizes and outputs this year to accommodate the growing demand for our most popular solar panel.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: USA, contact manufacturer for other countries  \nLocal Price: $295  \nAvailable online: yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Contact manufacturer  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[solarrolls-manual.pdf](/ast/98-solarrolls-manual.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Brunton\n\nBrunton  \nRiverton, WY  \n82501  \nUSA  \n307.857.4700  \n[info@brunton.com](mailto:info@brunton.com)  \n\n\n"

The mechanisms within the filter include both mechanical and biological processes. Mechanical processes include straining, adhesion and adsorption within the sand, whereas biological processes include predation by other organisms, die-off and inactivation and competition for food.\n\nAs micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and parasites travel through the sand, they are subject to both of these removal mechanisms. Over time, a biological zone gradually develops within the top layers the sand, the most dense/active part being the top few centimetres of sand – the origins of this biological population being the raw water fed into the filter. These micro-organisms form part of an active food chain that consumes pathogens (disease-causing organisms) as they are trapped in and on the sand surface, and in so doing the pathogens are removed and safe drinking water is produced. \n\nBioSandFilter.org is a resource website linking efforts by field practitioners and academics doing research on the biosand filter. It gives filter and mould instructions for those who want to make their own. Equally, for those that require it, moulds can be bought by BushProof, the Madagascar-based company that owns BioSandFilter.org.

Developed to address the needs of emerging market users, EzyStove replaces open fire cooking with a safe and healthy alternative. An EzyStove can reduce the amount of wood required to cook a meal from 40-60%, saving users' time, money and greatly reducing the environmental impact of cooking. EzyStove is also designed to be locally assembled without tools, thereby creating jobs and reducing the cost of transportation into rural areas by a factor of five.\n\nThe EzyStove consists of a fire chamber that is fitted into a metal support frame. The fire chamber and pot support frame are designed as a two-part system with the fire chamber lasting 2-3 years and the pot support frame lasting up to 10 years. As the fire chamber begins to wear out, a replacement fire chamber can be purchased and fitted inside the frame by the customer within seconds, reducing the replacement cost of a new stove by 50% or more.

The carbonized material is then crushed and formed into briquettes using a small press and a binder made from a source of starch such as cassava, a common root vegetable also known as yucca and manioc.

Jaundice is a serious health risk for babies if left untreated. Because of the high price of standard phototherapy devices, most hospitals in the developing world either do not have phototherapy or have substandard devices that provide ineffective treatment.\n\nBrilliance has been optimized for these settings with the following features:\n- Brilliance LEDs last 16-25x longer than compact fluorescent tube lights commonly used in phototherapy devices in low-resource hospitals. With Brilliance, hospitals can save over $200 per year on costly bulb replacements;\n- Brilliance consumes half the power of compact fluorescent tube lights. In case of blackout, it can be run off a battery back-up (the size of a car battery) for up to 8 hours;\n- Designed for extreme durability including protections against voltage surges, high use and other environmental challenges with minimal required maintenance;\n- Height and tilt adjustments to accommodate use with other critical NICU devices and meets UNICEF phototherapy specifications and can be used with hospital beds, bassinets and other treatment surfaces.\n\nWhereas the standard compact fluorescent light phototherapy devices only treat 42 babies before bulb replacement is required to maintain its effectiveness, a Brilliance device is estimated to treat approximately 1,042 babies.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIn late 2010, D-Rev licensed Brilliance to Chennai-based Phoenix Medical Systems. Phoenix is the largest manufacturer and seller of quality neonatal care equipment in India with 70% of the market share of compact florescent bulb phototherapy devices in the country. Phoenix will manufacture, distribute, and sell Brilliance throughout India and much of the rest of the world.

Despite scarce rainfall, desert areas contain valuable building materials such as sand, wheat, straw, twigs and other organic materials. By using these readily available resources to construct greenhouses, construction and operational costs are minimized and organic cultivation is achieved. As a result, desert greenhouses produce social, economic and ecological benefits. \n\nGrooves are dug in the sand which hold tree bark, sawdust, poultry manure or oil cake mixed evenly with sandy soil. When fully fermented, this mixture creates a vegetative environment in which seedlings can be planted. The temperature in the desert greenhouse is usually between 15 and 25 degrees centigrade for most kinds of planted fruits and vegetables. The operational greenhouse in China shows positive results as eggplants, peppers, watermelons, tomatoes and other crops prosper. \n\nThe annual cost to maintain a greenhouse is around $3,200 USD. To construct a greenhouse in a typical desert surrounding requires about $7,150 USD. A desert green house investor can gain back their investment within two years. \n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe Desert Greenhouse method can help overcome challenges of desertification by converting desert waste land into productive agricultural land.

In developed nations IV drips are delivered by electric pumps when dosing accuracy is needed. These provide and accurate and consistent flow but are expensive and require electricity. IV drips can be administered by gravity but current valves are not intuitive and require practice to use. In emergencies untrained persons are often performing IV administration and may give an incorrect dose due to the design of these valves. This improved valve adjusts flow volume linearly based on the position of a wheel. It is similar to existing designs but the groove the tube sits on is curved, which means the wheel compresses the tube gradually as it is spun up the track on the valve.This makes it easier to use and allows a scale to be printed on the valve body showing what the flow rate is at any given position. Flow rate can be adjusted quickly and with more certainty. This relatively simple design change to an existing product could save lives from medication errors.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe valve was invented by Design That Matters when they were trying to find ways to improve IV drip administration.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 2\"  \nWeight: 1g  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://designthatmatters.org/)  \n[Product page](http://static.squarespace.com/static/5267f3a6e4b0da2bab9939e3/t/528a0f31e4b0ff28fb891fdd/1384779569846/130118%20DtM%20Portfolio%20(w%20Cover)(small).pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Design that Matters\n\nDesign that Matters  \nCambridge, MA  \n02142  \nUSA  \n877.820.8479  \n[info@designthatmatters.org](mailto:info@designthatmatters.org)  \n\n\n"

The projector represents an innovative combination of cutting-edge hardware, \"abandoned\" technology and the creative re-purposing of existing products.\n\nThe Kinkajou light source is a five-watt white LED, a rugged, high-efficiency alternative to the fragile, expensive incandescent bulbs used in most commercial projectors. The LED is rated to last 100,000 hours, or the equivalent of eleven years of continuous operation. As an alternative to expensive glass lenses, the Kinkajou optics assembly cleverly incorporates seven plastic lenses adapted from existing \"View-Master\" toys. The resulting projection system can cast an image up to three meters wide from microfilm onto practically any flat surface--big enough for an entire classroom to read.\n\nBy combining microfilm with LEDs, DtM has found a novel application for what was considered an obsolete technology. Microfilm is durable and cheap. A microfilm reel of 10,000 pages--enough to accommodate an entire reference library--costs just US$6. Local language curriculum and accompanying images can easily and inexpensively be published to the microfilm spools.\n\nThe design is optimized for its intended market of rural communities in developing countries, with simple user cues and a rugged, dust-proof housing. The design requires no tools more complicated than pocket change for maintenance, and includes a battery, charge controller and solar panel for off-grid use.

In collaboration with Crestanks, a Ugandan manufacturer of plastic products, Design without Borders has developed an ecological urinal for domestic use. The urinal addresses challenges such as lack of space and cleanliness. Upkeep is simple and production is economical. The urinal preserves all nutrients in the urine, so that it can be easily processed to become high-quality fertilizer.\n\nFeatures:\n - Aimed towards private households\n - Based on a standardized plastic can, a product that is easily available and which users are familiar with\n - Prevents odors, takes up little space, and requires minimum upkeep\n - Inexpensive to produce and affordable for end-users\n - Portable, and therefore works well in the context of larger collection systems\n - Preserves all the nutrients in the urine, so that it can easily be processed into high-quality fertilizer\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\n44% of the inhabitants of Uganda’s capital Kampala live in slum areas with high population density. The slum residents lack space and often cannot afford their own toilets.  The most common toilet solutions are therefore shared pay toilets, or buckets and plastic bags. In a number of neighborhoods, more than 1000 people share the same toilet.\n\nThe fecal matter from public toilets is either emptied onto the streets or into open sewers running through residential areas. It then filters into the ground water, reaching wells or other places where people come into contact with it. The spread of bacteria from fecal matter is the source of about 80% of diseases in the slum areas. In addition, women and children frequently become the victims of sexual assault and rape when they approach public toilets after dark.\n\nDesign without Borders provides innovation and design services to create social impact.

While many of the highly potent drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS and TB are toxic to the liver, deaths due to drug-induced liver failure are very rare in countries like the United States, where a patient’s liver function is monitored regularly. Yet this is not the case in resource-poor countries, where roughly 20% of TB patients and 25% of HIV/AIDS patients, lacking access to diagnostic tools, succumb to liver complications related to their treatment.\n\nDesigned specifically for use in the developing world, DFA’s device will enable semi-quantitative determination of two key liver enzymes, AST (aspartate transaminase) and ALT (alanine transaminase), which are routinely used to measure liver toxicity amongst patients receiving antiretroviral medications. As the liver becomes damaged by potent medications, these two enzymes, usually found in the liver, are released into the blood stream. From a single drop of whole blood, this test will determine whether blood levels of these two enzymes are baseline/normal, greater than two-times baseline/normal, or greater than five-times baseline/normal. The 2x and 5x thresholds, which indicate that treatments should be “monitored closely” or “altered immediately”, correspond to protocols established by the U.S. FDA to guide treatment during clinical trials.\n\nThe liver function test is targeted to cost $0.10 or less, will be about the size of a postage stamp, and will function without external power or equipment. The output will be a straightforward, semi-quantitative colorimetric indication of enzyme levels and will be easily integrated into telemedicine networks.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nPaper is significantly less expensive than other materials typically used in diagnostic devices and is compatible with a variety of existing diagnostic tests. It inherently wicks biological samples through channels patterned in the paper to assay zones, and its mesh-like properties filter the sample of contaminants such as dust and dirt.\n\nDFA’s devices can be brought directly to those who are unable to travel to hospitals or clinics and, with no mechanical parts, are robust enough for use even under severe environmental conditions. No auxiliary equipment, electricity, or laboratory facility is needed to use the device or process a sample. Results are quickly displayed, enabling immediate clinical decisions.\n\nMinimal training is required to use a DFA device. It is both user-friendly and minimally invasive. A sample from a finger prick is sufficient to yield results. No syringes are involved and neither clean water nor sample preparation is needed. Results are displayed in an easily understood manner, as through a colorimetric scale.\n\nBefore distribution, devices are packaged so that they are protected from the environment and provide adequate shelf life for transport and storage in the developing world. While DFA devices are single-use, they can be easily and safely disposed of through incineration, assuring that they do not contribute to the global medical waste problem.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.dfa.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.dfa.org/projects/liver-function.php)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Diagnostics For All\n\nUna Ryan  \nDiagnostics For All  \nCambridge  \n 02139  \nUSA  \n617.494.0700  \n[info@dfa.org](mailto:info@dfa.org)  \n\n\n"

The method consists of three elements:\n\n- A framework of Eco-Beams (timber and metal beams that form the framework for the sandbag walls)\n- Specially formulated geo-fabric bags, filled with sand and stacked between the beams\n- Cladding with wire mesh and either plaster, timber or plasterboard\n\nThe completed structure is waterproof, fire resistant and soundproof and has beneficial thermal properties (cool in summer and warm in winter). While standard walls may develop cracks in the plasterwork that carry through the entire wall, cracks do not develop throughout sandbag walls.\n\nOnce the framework is in place, filling and stacking sandbags may be undertaken by unskilled workers or by the owners themselves, reducing labor costs and potentially providing job opportunities to the local community. Much of the sand required to build the structure can be obtained on-site.\n\nThis form of construction is ideal in isolated areas, as the weight and design of the construction material makes it easy to transport. Adoption of the Eco-Beam Sandbag system can decrease building costs while remaining environmentally friendly. \n\nEco-Beam Sandbag homes can be produced and built in a short period of time, as no masonry is necessary. Once the beams and bags have been transported to the site, the framework can be erected within a few days.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nEcoSteps is an Alternate Building and Energy Consulting Business founded in 2010.  \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.ecosteps.co.za)  \n[Product page](http://www.ecosteps.co.za/sandbag-building/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: EcoSteps\n\nRodney Wall  \nEcoSteps  \nHoedspruit  \n1380  \nSouth Africa  \n+27 073 510 5533  \n[rodney@ecosteps.co.za](mailto:rodney@ecosteps.co.za)  \n\n\n"

The spectacle frames consist of a lightweight and flexible frame made of extremely robust, rustproof and hypoallergenic spring steel wire (1 mm). The frames are manufactured by hand on a bending device which does not need a power supply. Different physiognomies can be taken into account individually when bending the frame. The elliptical polished, unbreakable lenses are given the notches and steps for fastening in the spectacle frames on the milling attachment and can be inserted in no time. This milling machine can be operated via a decentralized power supply thanks to the low power consumption (generator or solar station). Heat-shrinkable sleeves made of hypoallergenic plastic on the ear piece ends increase the wearing comfort of the glasses. Because the glasses have very little weight, they do not require nosebridges. Two coloured glass pearls give each pair of glasses its own personal design.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nFigures from the WHO show that around 150 million people in the world suffer from defective eyesight which could be rectified with a simple seeing aid. Many of these people live on a very small budget which prevents them from buying a conventional pair of glasses. This has serious consequences for them: Their poor vision prohibits people from working or pursuing vocational training – the loss to national income worldwide that occurs due to this issue, is estimated to be around 120 billion dollars per year.\n\nUntil now, people in developing and emerging countries have mainly helped themselves by recycling old glasses – but they are difficult to recondition and adjust. Additionally, there is often a lack of local knowledge and technical equipment. Another economic alternative could be glasses from China. However, these have not reached a sufficient distribution so far, because costs are still too high (due to shipping in regions off the major trade routes) and appropriate distribution structures are missing.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Burkina Faso, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Bolivia, Ethiopia, Uganda  \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.onedollarglasses.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.onedollarglasses.org)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.empowering-people-award.siemens-stiftung.org/en/shortlist/projects/onedollarglasses/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: EinDollarBrille e.V.\n\nMartin Aufmuth  \nEinDollarBrille e.V.  \nErlangen  \n91058  \nGermany  \n+49 (0) 9131–9232803  \n[info@onedollarglasses.org](mailto:info@onedollarglasses.org)  \n\n\n"

The design looks like a miniature sleeping bag, but in reality, will saves lives of vulnerable infants. It is a new, low-cost solution to help keep low birth weight babies' body temperature warm so they can survive and thrive in developing countries.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Heat the phase-change pouch using the electric heater or the non-electric heating unit with hot water. Within 20 minutes, the pouch will heat up to 37C (98.6F), a temperature critical to a child’s survival.\n2. Place the heated pouch into the sleeping bag warmer and lay the baby inside. The pouch can be reheated hundreds of times. An indicator shows when it needs to be reheated.\n3. The pouch will remain between 37-35C for at least four hours. The phase-change material will absorb heat from the baby if the baby gets too hot, or release heat if the baby gets too cold.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\n20,000,000 low-birth-weight and premature babies are born each year. This occurs primarily in developing countries, often in areas that don’t have access to innovations in modern medicine. One of the biggest problems these babies face is hypothermia: they are not able to regulate their own body temperature, and therefore cannot stay warm. In fact, room temperature for these small infants feels freezing cold. 4 million babies die within their first month of life. Those that do survive often develop life-long health problems such as early onset of diabetes, heart disease, and low IQ.\n\nTraditional incubators cost up to $20,000. Many of these babies could be saved with an incubator, but traditional incubators are expensive and not available, nor appropriate, for rural areas that don’t have access to electricity. “Many premature babies are never given a chance to make it out of the hospital,\"\" says Crystal, a missionary in Uganda, “Because there are no incubators, the babies are left to die. They are put on a table or directly in the trash without the comforting touch of their mothers in those final moments.” In light of these constraints, current solutions are in-home remedies. Desperate methods create to take care of these vulnerable babies include wrapping hot water bottles around their bodies or placing them near ovens. These solutions are unsafe and cause many infants to die unnecessarily. If given simple and proper medical treatment, many would not only survive, but grow and thrive.\n\nEmbrace donates our low-cost Infant Warmer to populations in need through establishing partnerships with like-minded NGOs who are serving our target communities. Emergency Embrace, our humanitarian assistance program, supplies Infant Warmers to organizations working in areas facing dire situations on a short-term basis.

Installed as a permanent structure, the Enviro Loo never requires replacement, relocation or removal. \n\nThe Enviro Loo is a \"dry or waterless sanitation system\". Liquid and solid waste are separated as they enter the container via the toilet bowl. Liquid waste drains to the bottom of the container while solid waste remains on the drying plate. The waste is exposed to continuous airflow that is driven through the unit by the forced aeration ventilation system. The movement of air is assisted by the ventilation extraction unit positioned on top of the outlet vent pipe. As the air moves through the system, it dehydrates the solid waste as it migrates down the sloped drying plate. The liquid that has drained to the bottom of the container evaporates. Sunlight absorbed by the black inspection cover increases the ambient temperature within the container. \n\nThe intense heat, prolonged retention periods and oxygen-rich air that is drawn in dehydrate and decompose the waste. At the end of this process the waste is converted via the stimulated bacterial and biological activity into an inoffensive, stabilized material which is reduced to roughly 5% of its original volume. The negative pressure within the container prevents the escape of any odor through the toilet bowl or the air inlet pipes. \n\nCurrently, there are four Enviro Loo models available with the same standard of materials and principles. The differences reside in capacity and unit specifications. The solutions are catered to domestic, communal and industrial uses. The prices of the systems vary from $480 to $680 USD.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nAn estimated 23 million South Africans don�t have access to adequate sanitation facilities. Those who have inadequate sanitation may be using the bucket system, pit toilets or sadly, open defecation. The impact of inadequate sanitation on the health of the poor is significant in terms of the quality of life, and the education and development potential of communities. 1,000 deaths per-day in South Africa are caused by waterborne disease. Improved sanitation facilities help lower mortality rates while improving education, wellbeing and environmental sustainability. \n\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Namibia, Kenya, Ghana, Angola, Nigeria, Gabon, Zambia, India and Jordon  \nPrice range (USD): over 200 USD  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Product page](http://www.enviro-loo.com/index.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Enviro Options (Pty) Ltd\n\nEnviro Options (Pty) Ltd  \nKrugersdorp  \nSouth Africa  \n+27 11 762 1624  \n[info@enviroloo.co.za](mailto:info@enviroloo.co.za)  \n\n\n"

Esoko's focus is on agricultural value chains with the explicit goal of improving the transparency of markets and the operational efficiency of organizations. The founders believe mobile phones provide an unprecedented and disruptive opportunity to change how markets work for both businesses and consumers. \n\nOn one hand, Esoko collects and provides content such as prices, bids and offers, weather, and agricultural tips to which users can subscribe. On the other, Esoko provides a powerful set of tools so that organizations can manage their own information and content: not only pushing out alerts and advisories to the field, but also tracking information from the field (like activities, compliance, profiles). \n\nSmallholder farmers can sign up to Esoko to receive a package of weekly advisory services. This typically consists of current market prices, matching bids and offers, weather forecasts, and news and tips. \nNot only can farmers negotiate better prices, choose different markets, or time sales better, but they may also participate in outgrower schemes through Esoko profiling and reputational history. The goal is simply to put more money into the hands of smallholder farmers, and try to address the information asymmetry that exists where farmers are frequently disadvantaged price-takers, often selling at a loss. After receiving better information, income improvements for farmers are estimated to be between 10-30%. Sometimes individual sales to new markets can increase by 100%. Esoko is not trying to remove the important role that traders must continue to play, but believes a more transparent system will reduce the overall time to market for goods, improve margins for all, and create an ecosystem of facilitation and brokering.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nBased in Mauritius and Ghana, Esoko is a private business, focused on changing the way markets work through innovative mobile solutions. Esoko was established in 2005 simply to collect and distribute market prices via SMS, and over the years the team and business has evolved. \n\nToday, Esoko is a team of 60, half of whom are building the technology and the other half focused on providing consulting and support services to our partners and clients across the world. Financed privately by two individuals, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF), Esoko's team believes that private sector service organizations, which are accountable to clients for their revenues and long-term survival, are an effective means of development. Esoko is focused on client needs, professional services, fiscal discipline and social change. The team is an ambitious, animated, committed and fun group of young technology pioneers who believe that the scale and opportunity of African Agriculture is irresistible. \n\nEsoko has a diverse range of partners, including international organizations, businesses, NGOs, research institutions, and mobile network operators (MNOs), throughout the globe. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.esoko.com/)  \n[Product page](http://www.esoko.com/about/index.php#overview)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2011/09/05/in-african-agriculture-information-is-power/)  \n[ghana-esoko-2010.pdf](/ast/284-ghana-esoko-2010.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Esoko\n\nMark Davies  \nEsoko  \nAccra  \nGhana  \n+233 30 221 1611  \n[ghana@esoko.com](mailto:ghana@esoko.com)  \n\n\n"

Even without rain water, water can be provided for crops, if the roots come into contact with the water table zone. Georadar (GPR, Ground Penetrating Radar) is used as a non-destructive technique for low-depth subsoil investigation, which produces excellent results in terms of soil profile mapping. It consists of an electromagnetic waves unit and a second digital recording system unit. Wave reflection time delays and wave speed in the material containing the antennae, are used to deduce the depth at which the reflector unit (pipe) is located. The georadar generates a subsoil image with high lateral and vertical resolution which not only identifies specific objects, but also characterizes the area.\n\nThe depth of penetration and the resolution depend on which type of antenna is used. In high-resolution urban areas shielded antennas are used, because they are better equipped to control noise and air reflections with high-quality imaging and a depth range of up to 10 m.\n\nEstudio G&D uses existing technology in a new context. The innovation is the compact, small-scale technology, which makes it easy to transport.  Thus big areas can be analyzed without costly and labor-intensive drillings. Deeper soil and ground water levels can also be detected.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Mexico  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.estudiogyd.com.ar/ncms/)  \n[Product page](http://www.estudiogyd.com.ar/ncms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4:agricultura-de-precision&catid=1:portada&Itemid=12)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.empowering-people-award.siemens-stiftung.org/en/shortlist/projects/mapeo-de-napas-con-georadar-soil-research/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Estudio G&D\n\nEstudio G&D  \nBuenos Aires  \nArgentina  \n+54 (0249) 4447899   \n[info@estudiogyd.com.ar](mailto:info@estudiogyd.com.ar)  \n\n\n"

The solution is based on an innovative patent pending concept that is ideal for rapid temporary rehousing in emergency situations, as well as being repurposed for permanent housing.\n\nThe concept inspires housing construction methods that are an alternative to typical corrugated iron-sheeted roof structures that are ubiquitous throughout slums. By integrating local materials such as clay or lime-stone, it is possible to plaster the shelter to have a more permanent and solid structure.\n\nFeatures:\n- Simple and easy to erect\n- Cost effective\n- Mobile and reusable\n- Well-insulated\n- Sturdy\n- Adaptable design\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nToo many shelter solutions consist of emergency tents or transitional housing materials that turn into waste after a relatively short life.

These conditions claim the lives of an estimated 63,000 women each year, as well as the lives of many of their babies.1 Where a woman gives birth should not decide her fate, and yet the risk that a woman in a developing country will die of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is approximately 300 times higher than that for a woman in a developed country.1  Several studies have identified magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) as the most effective anticonvulsant for preventing and treating the life-threatening seizures of eclampsia.  MgSO4 is needed at every level of the health care system where deliveries occur, from urban hospitals to rural clinics.2  Most of women with pre-eclampsia will also require antihypertensive therapy, even while on MgSO4.10 Supportive policies and appropriate practices are required to take this important medicine to scale to help reach the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 target: reducing maternal mortality by 75% by 2015. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nLaunched by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon during the United Nations Millennium Development Goals Summit in September 2010, Every Woman Every Child aims to save the lives of 16 million women and children by 2015.

With its technology, eye tests can now be performed by and for anyone in the comfort of his or her own home. The team was inspired by the poor user experience in traditional hospitals, especially in the developing world, and by the more than two billion people worldwide living with vision impairments.\n\nNetraG is the world’s first and only smartphone vision diagnostic tool. Unlike traditional eyecare equipment, it enables highly accurate, self-administered tests with minimal training. Its sleek design and compact size allows it to travel anywhere, reducing the barriers to access and affordability for those in more remote areas of the world. By leveraging social networks and health data, NetraG keeps people connected to the right providers and vendors to ensure they get the care they need.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nEyeNettrastarted in December of 2009 with NETRA (Near-Eye Tool for Refractive Assessment), a low-cost clip-on for cell phones to measure refractive conditions. In 2010 we developed CATRA, a similar device to measure cataracts. In 2011 we developed tailored displays, a new kind of display that compensates for the user's vision condition, avoiding the need for eyeglasses.\n\nIn the course of these innovations, we have produced several papers, patents and grants. In 2011, we established EyeNetra, the VC-backed company that is building and commercializing NETRA worldwide.

With 1.5 billion people living off-the-grid at the base of the pyramid, we knew that we needed to find a scalable solution. So we started the design process with need finding. We traveled across East Africa and Central Asia where we became inspired by the creative and innovative ways people accessed electricity but – at the same time – distraught by how unreliable and expensive these homegrown solutions were.\n\nWe saw a huge need that wasn’t being well-served. About 600 million people use cell phones even though they don’t have access to energy and even more people depend on burning kerosene for lighting, which can be dirty, dangerous and expensive. So we wanted to design a high quality battery that would charge mobile phones, lights and other devices, and would be powered by renewable energy, be sophisticated enough to meet people’s energy needs, be durable enough to withstand the environment, yet be simple and sleek in its design so everyone could use it.\n\nThat’s why we created the ReadySet. We’re delivering this renewable energy system because we want to enable people to access the global economy through mobile technology, and to have clean, safe and affordable light. Inspired by how “mobile banking” revolutionized financial independence, we believe that “mobile energy” is the next exciting frontier.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: USA, Rwanda, Uganda  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nAvailable online: yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Contact Fenix for details  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://fenixintl.com/)  \n[Product page](http://fenixintl.com/products/readyset-solar-kit/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Fenix Intl\n\nFenix Intl  \nSan Francisco  \n94107  \nUSA  \n[Contact](http://fenixintl.com/contact/)  \n\n\n"

Here's how it works: The lens consists of two optical lenses with third grade surfaces. Because one lens is the exact inversion of the other, the moment they are placed exactly behind each other the strength of the lens is zero. Converting the lens along the x-axis changes the intensity of the Alvarez lens. Doing the same thing for the y-axis changes the astigmatic correction of the Alvarez lens. The Alvarez lens rectifies all refraction and astigmatic deviations by displacing one lens over the x- and y-axis and by turning the complete lens around the z-axis (optical axis).    \n\nThe lenses of the Focusspec are made of high-quality polycarbonate. The frame and temples are made of industrial-grade plastics. The frame, lenses and the worm wheel are put together by ultrasonic welding, making the spectacles less vulnerable to dust and dirt. Silicone parts are used in the newest model of the Focusspec to make the glasses fit around different noses. \n\nApproximately 80% of the people who need refractive correction can be helped with Focusspec glasses.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nApproximately 3.5 billion people today have an eye condition which requires most of them to wear glasses (or lenses) to see properly. \n\nOn a visit to Tanzania in 2002, Frederik van Asbeck, a young Dutch student who is myopic, discovered that people with poor vision in Tanzania could not get their sight problems checked and resolved, simply because there was not any eye care service to speak of.\n\nAs approximately 80% of the cases of poor vision can be helped with refractive correction (i.e. with glasses), he got involved in a project to develop adjustable glasses on the basis of the Alvarez principle at the University.\n\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide   \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.focus-on-vision.org/en/home/)  \n[Product page](http://www.focus-on-vision.org/en/home/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Focus On Vision\n\nFocus On Vision  \nEindhoven  \n5657 EB  \nThe Netherlands   \n8187.36.392  \n[info@focus-on-vision.org](mailto:info@focus-on-vision.org)  \n\n\n"

The three loose housing systems proposed in this work correspond to the needs and possibilities of most livestock raisers of young cattle in the developing countries.\n\nAfter a concise description of these housing systems, the standards which have to be respected and the circuits called for, users need a more detailed description of how this housing is built, and that will be the topic of this second part of the work.\n\nWhichever system is selected, housing is made up of a certain number of components, such as the manger, the drinking-trough, the fencing, and so forth, which fill highly specific functions.

In addition to wall recharging ability, you can power it yourself using the trusted Freeplay self-charge technology, so you'll never run out of power.  That, combined with the reliability of ultra-bright white LEDs rated for 100,000 hours, makes the Indigo Lantern the most dependable lantern on the market.  With the peace of mind of never needing to ever replace batteries or bulbs, you'll know that your Indigo Lantern will work whenever you need it, anytime, anywhere.  Yet you'll have excellent brightness and shine time.\n\nIdeal for everyday and emergency use, indoors and out, the Indigo Lantern puts the power in your hands.  The self-charge system offers maximum dependability for those times when you can’t afford to be left in the dark by dead batteries.  A quick wind (about 60 seconds) provides up to 1 hour of light using the directional light – and you can wind again at any time for as much shine-time as you want.  An LED charge level indicator tells you the optimal winding speed.\n\nUsing the dimmer switch, the Indigo allows you to adjust the brightness of the lantern to your specific requirements, from maximum brightness to a night-light.  This also allows you to maximize your shine time:  the lower the brightness, the longer the shine.\n\nThe included reading light / flashlight is also an LED with excellent performance, delivering an hour of brilliant white light per 60-second wind.\n\nThe Indigo Lantern is rechargeable and, when fully charged, the lantern provides up to 8 hours of continuous ultra bright light, and 100 hours of night-light, using the LED cluster.  Similarly the directional light will shine for up to 40 hours continuously.\n\nThe rechargeable battery means that there is no use of disposable batteries that are harmful to the environment.  Not even for \"spare power\":  you are the spare power.\n\nInternal mechanical components are specified to industrial standards for repeated use and long life.  A handle swings up to let you to carry or hang the lantern as required, and the sturdy rubber feet allow for placement on uneven surfaces.\n\nWith the Freeplay Indigo Lantern, you’ve got light anytime, anywhere.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIt was whilst watching a BBC documentary in April 1994 when Chris Staines first realized the potential of an innovative idea from British inventor, Trevor Baylis. \"The Clockwork Radio\", as the device was first known, was proposed as a means of halting the spread of Aids in Africa through better education. Traditional radio, although widespread, relied on an electrical supply or the availability of disposable batteries - both of which were in short supply across the continent.Chris and his business partner, Rory Stear, immediately realised that the potential for self-sufficient electronics could go much further than radio and Africa. And so the \"self-sufficient electronics industry\", and the Freeplay Energy Group (the company formed to develop the idea) were born.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nAvailable online: yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Contact manufacturer  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: Height: 170mm Depth: 65mm Width: 60mm  \nWeight: 300 g  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.freeplayenergy.com/)  \n[Product page](http://www.freeplayenergy.com/aid-and-development/products/indigo-lantern)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Freeplay Energy Ltd\n\nFreeplay Energy Ltd  \nLondon  \nW1U 8JW  \nUnited Kingdom  \n1-866-697-7529  \n[info@freeplayenergy.com](mailto:info@freeplayenergy.com)  \n\n\n"

For many of the poorest families, peanuts are the only protein they can afford. For many they a crop of choice to take to market, but they have little value in the shell.  And a sun-dried, unroasted peanut in the shell is much tougher than the roasted-in-the-shell kind wealthy people buy in the supermarket.  1 kilo or a little more than 2 lbs an hour is a normal shelling rate.  And women, through their skin, can absorb the very toxic aflatoxins that can develop on the outside of the shell. \n\nThe Full Belly Project's award winning (Popular Mechanics, MIT) Universal Nut Sheller does peanuts at the rate of 50 kg/hr (120 lbs/hr).  Adjustable for any size of nut. Because of their softer shell, aflatoxin contaminated peanuts tend to pass through unshelled for easy sorting. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIn 2001, Jock traveled to Mali to fix a small village's water treatment system. While there he came across a woman who informed him that it would be of great service to her village if he could find an affordable peanut sheller for them. Upon returning to the\tUnited States he contacted peanut authority Dr. Tim Williams of the University of Georgia who told Brandis of a Bulgarian Peanut Shelling design. Jock adapted the design with help from a friend Wes Perry. Jock went through several iterations of a redesign and one year later he completed the machine that is now called the Universal Nut Sheller.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nAvailable online: yes  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.thefullbellyproject.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.thefullbellyproject.org/Products/UniversalNutSheller.aspx)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: The Full Belly Project\n\nJock Brandies  \nThe Full Belly Project  \nWilmington, NC  \n28406   \nUSA  \n1-910-452-0975  \n[info@thefullbellyproject.org](mailto:info@thefullbellyproject.org)  \n\n\n"

Terra Preta is more than 5000 years practice in parts of Amazon basin until the Europeans arrived. Along with charcoal the rural trash consisting of pottery shards, fish bones, compost, etc. was added to the less fertile acidic soils to improve fertility of the soils. The biochar application is useful as a means of carbon sequestration and mitigating global warming issues too. \n\nThe value of charcoal was known to Indians and utilized as part of traditional and cultural practices for various purposes. The charcoal was never considered as a waste material. The crop residue burnt in the fields gets converted into charcoal and ash. In the process, the earth (soil) also gets burnt. This practice benefited the soils and farmers since ages (here no comparison with composting the biomass). The slash and burn in the margins of the forests or inside the forests is a very well known practice all over India (although it is no more sustainable because of huge population demands and costing the sustainability of forests). The charcoal, a byproduct of the traditional stoves is added to the farm yard manure / compost, which gets inoculated with the soil microbes, which was later transferred to the fields. The waste from the potters kiln a combination of charcoal, pottery shards and little ash was always a valuable source for improving the fertility of the soils. Although the addition of charcoal to the soils was existing as a practice, but it was not explicit, it remained as part of traditional best practices in India. As we explore more and more evidences are visible and proves that the Indian farmers were using charcoal since hundreds of years. Because of such good practices agricultural activity is still sustainable in many parts of India. \n\n---- #summary ----\n\nThe Geoecology Energy Organisation is now promoting the production of biochar, a pure carbon charcoal obtained by burning plant and agricultural waste in confined spaces. It is an extremely potent fertilizer that enriches soil, enhances microorganism growth, and promotes oxygen circulation around plants. The process also sequesters carbon, mitigating global warming.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Free  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.e-geo.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.e-geo.org)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Geoecology Energy Organisation [GEO]\n\nSai Bhaskar Reddy Nakka  \nGeoecology Energy Organisation [GEO]  \nHYDERABAD  \n500013  \nIndia  \n09246352018  \n[saibhaskarnakka@gmail.com](mailto:saibhaskarnakka@gmail.com)  \n\n\n"

This gives the grains a golden color, as opposed to regular white rice, which is practically devoid of carotenoids. When the rice is consumed, the β-carotene is either stored in the fatty tissues of the body or converted into vitamin A.  People living on a poor diet are at risk of becoming vitamin A deficient, which can lead to life-threatening illnesses.\n\nRice produces β-carotene in the leaves but not in the grain, where the biosynthetic pathway is turned off during plant development. In Golden Rice, two genes have been inserted into the rice genome through genetic engineering, to restart the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway leading to the production and accumulation of β-carotene in the grains. Both genes are naturally involved in carotene biosynthesis. The difference here is that the reconstructed pathway is not subject to down regulation, as usually happens in the grain.\n\nThe intensity of the golden color is a visual indicator of the concentration of β-carotene in the endosperm. The goal is to make sure that people living in rice-based societies get a full complement of provitamin A from their traditional diets. This would apply to countries such as India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Golden Rice could still be a valuable complement to children's diets in many countries by contributing to the reduction of clinical and sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency-related diseases.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nGolden Rice was invented by Ingo Potrykus, Professor emeritus of the Institute for Plant Sciences of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and Professor Peter Beyer, of the Centre for Applied Biosciences, University of Freiburg, Germany. The search for Golden Rice began as a Rockefeller Foundation initiative in 1982. After years of research by various research groups, a meeting of experts was convened in New York in 1992. There, Ingo Potrykus and Peter Beyer met for the first time, and subsequently decided to embark on the project that would lead to the development of Golden Rice in 1999. Their great contribution consisted of showing that a very complex biosynthetic pathway could be tweaked to enhance the health-promoting virtues of a crop. The breakthrough insight was that most of the pathway was already present in the rice grain and it only needed two genes to reset the entire pathway.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.goldenrice.org/index.php)  \n[Product page](http://www.goldenrice.org/index.php)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Golden Rice Humanitarian Board\n\nGolden Rice Humanitarian Board  \nZurich  \nSwitzerland  \n[contact@goldenrice.org](mailto:contact@goldenrice.org)  \n\n\n"

These grassroots entrepreneurs, Village Phone Operators, then rent the use of the phone on a per-call basis providing both affordable telecommunications access in their community while earning enough to repay their loan and raise their level of income. Once they have paid back the loan, the Village Phone business kit is theirs to keep and to continue their business.\n\nIn many countries, telecommunications companies have not defined a public access strategy for rural markets. In this case, Village Phone allows an MFI, or other organization, to bring mobile communication services and new business opportunities to communities that may have been overlooked by traditional telecommunications access. Village Phone benefits all parties involved:- Village Phone Operators are given a unique opportunity to earn a new source of income that can complement an existing business. In addition, many of the Village Phone Operators are female, helping to increase the status of women in the community.- Community members no longer have to travel to make a phone call and can stay in touch with family and friends and increase their productivity.- The microfinance institution, or other organization providing loans for the Village Phone business kit, gains revenue from loan interest and potentially from airtime sales and helps set into place a network of phones that can be used as a platform for future innovation.- Finally, the telecom operator is able to reach a new market through a channel not previously utilized.\n\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nOver the past decade, the mobile phone has become a powerful tool for providing poor people with access to information and services that can improve their lives and their livelihoods.

With the majority of the country’s population living without access to the electricity grid, it becomes necessary to look to renewable sources for energy needs. Grameen Shakti uses PV modules imported from Japan in order to install solar home systems to houses in Bangladesh. Depending on household income and family needs, Grameen Shakti installs smaller systems that deliver 10 to 20 Wp, and larger systems at around 40 to 120 Wp. The larger system is ideal for powering a sufficient set of lights, a radio, and phone charger. Smaller modules power LED lights.\n\n\nThe charge controllers are manufactured by Grameen Shakti itself, but LED lights and batteries are purchased from companies in Bangladesh. A 50 Wp system can cost around 215 pounds, whereas a smaller 20 Wp system can cost around 115 pounds.

Spinal injuries – even leading to death - are common among people carrying up to 40 lbs. on water on their heads every day.  Most women use dirty buckets or jerry cans that previously held pesticides, fuel or other chemicals.\n\nPackH2O is an alternative to buckets and jerry cans to carry water home and help keep it clean. The water backpack can help keep water clean as it’s carried and stored because it can be hung up even when full.  PackH2O starts out clean and has a removable liner that, after use, is easily sanitized with exposure to sunlight. The PackH2O relieves the physical stress of carrying water by distributing the burden evenly on the wearer’s back.  The PackH2O is easy to carry, shifting and distributing the weight to the wearer’s back – a healthier solution.\n\nThe PackH2O is 7 times lighter and 7 times smaller than a jerry can that holds the same amount of water. That means the PackH2O is less expensive to ship and requires less room to store than rigid containers – a key consideration in emergency relief and shipping to remote water-stressed regions.\n\nFeatures include:- Double Liner- Chlorine tablet pouch- Adjustable shoulder straps- Protective Cover- Volume: 5 gallons- Strap strength: 352 lb- Puncture resistance w/poly liner: 52 lbf- Drain Spout- Hand straps- Puncture-resistant shell- Reflective tape- Weight: 43 lbf- Backpack seam strength: 13.8 lbf- Tear resistance of backpack fabric: 63 lbf\n\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nEach pack is $10 USD.

It supports subsistence farmers in Northern Mozambique to sustain food security through reduction of post-harvest losses. Furthermore, the silo helps the farmer families to adapt to climate change that is extending the drought-caused October-to-January 'hunger period.' \n\nThe basic design of the ZEFRA is a weaved bamboo structure covered with clay on both sides. It stands on a base that incorporates vermin traps to protect the grain from rats and mice.  The ZERFA is installed under a simple shelter to maintain cool, dry and constant conditions. Compared to other metal silos, the ZEFRA is affordable and sustainable as the techniques required rely entirely on existing local knowledge and can easily be replicated without creating dependence on technical assistance or external inputs.\n\nThe ZEFRA has material and labour costs of approximately USD 50 and a storage capacity of 250 kg. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nMozambique, along with many developing countries in the global South, is vulnerable to drought. Resulting harvest failures cause food insecurity which consequently  lead to a lack of seed material for upcoming cropping seasons. With changing seasonal rainfall patterns and periods, subsistence farmers practicing rain fed agriculture are struggling to keep sufficient food/seed reserves to overcome the hunger period (December–April). \n\nTraditional post-harvest storage facilities cause losses of up to 40% of stocks and are responsible for 22% of households running out of stock for more than 2 months each year. As a result, many families apply survival strategies such as reducing the number of meals per day, lowering the quality of their diet, consuming their seeds and selling production assets. \n\nThe ZEFRA reduces the vulnerability from droughts by enabling communities and individual farmers to enhance their food security trough reduction of post-harvest losses and the establishment of seed banks that store sufficient seed reserves. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): 20 to 50 USD  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.helvetas.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.helvetas.org)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation\n\nKarolina Merai  \nHELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation  \nZurich  \n8021  \nSwitzerland  \n+41 44 368 65 00  \n[karolina.merai@helvetas.org](mailto:karolina.merai@helvetas.org)  \n\n\n"

The CWP fits snugly into the top of a specially designed plastic container with a lid to protect against recontamination. Hydrologic CWPs are manufactured in Cambodia using locally available resources and skills. \n\nWhen filled with untreated water, the CWP percolates water through the ceramic pot by gravity filtration at a typical rate of 1-3 liters per hour.

Hydrologic filters dispense water from a tap, increasing their effectiveness and ease of use.\n\nHydrologic Social Enterprise currently produces two CWP models to target different market segments, a basic CWP and a larger model with extra storage volume and more attractive external styling. \n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nWhen Hydrologic Social Enterprise was founded in 2009, 66% of Cambodian households (18 million people) lacked access to safe drinking water. These conditions resulted in 10 million cases of diarrhea and 10,000 deaths per year. Young children are particularly vulnerable and water-borne disease was a major contributor to Cambodia’s under-five mortality (88/1000 live births), one of the highest rates in Asia (UNICEF 2009). \n\nA 2007 UNICEF study in Cambodia showed that use of CWPs resulted in a 46% reduction in diarrheal disease. Families using CWPs can also expect significant economic benefits. A 2010 study by iDE found that households using CWPs saved US$73 per year on medical bills and on lost wages related to diarrhea, compared to people who do not treat their water. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Peru, Ecuador, Columbia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, China, Philippines, Indonesia  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.hydrologichealth.com)  \n[Product page](http://www.hydrologichealth.com/category/products/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Hydrologic Social Enterprise\n\nMichael Roberts  \nHydrologic Social Enterprise  \nPhnom Penh  \nCambodia  \n023 6911 981  \n[info@hydrologichealth.com](mailto:info@hydrologichealth.com)  \n\n\n"

It is made from low-precision parts, making it cheaper, more reliable and easier to repair than piston pumps. Washers of locally-available material are tied some distance apart on a long loop of rope, which is threaded down into a well and back up through a pipe. As the rope leaves the pipe it passes over a wheel and back down into the well. As the wheel is turned, the washers bring water up in a continuous stream through the pipe.\n\nApplications:\n- For depth to water up to 18m, the rope pump can be used for irrigating small plots in addition to other domestic water uses.\n- For depths of water beyond 18m, the rope pump is best suited for domestic use. Irrigation would be limited to dense agriculture like seedling nurseries\n- If the rope pump’s drilled well has a casing, it can be sealed to protect the water, as opposed to wells with treadle pumps\n- Repairs can be done with local materials, as opposed to many imported piston pumps\n- Suitable for multiple use/shared use for domestic applications \n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\niDE is an international non-profit dedicated to ending poverty in the developing world not through handouts, but by helping farm families access the tools and knowledge they need to increase their income. \n\niDE's origins as a formal organization lie in a visit to a Somalian refugee camp in 1982.

These systems are water efficient, using a pressure treadle pump or drip system header, and can significantly increase yields.

The systems are expandable if a farmer wishes to irrigate more land.\n\nThere are two models of sprinkler irrigations systems:\n\nMini Sprinkler Irrigation Systems\nMini sprinklers are ideal for use with pressure treadle pumps, and their relatively low flow allows them to be used in erosion-prone areas where higher-flow sprinklers, like impact sprinklers, would not work.\n\nImpact Sprinkler Irrigation Systems\nLow pressure Impact sprinklers are powered by motorized pumps. They have a high discharge with a greater throw diameter than mini sprinklers at the same pressure head, so they are suitable for larger fields of closely-spaced crops, where water scarcity prohibits flood irrigation. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\niDE is an international non-profit dedicated to ending poverty in the developing world not through handouts, but by helping farm families access the tools and knowledge they need to increase their income. \n\niDE's origins as a formal organization lie in a visit to a Somalian refugee camp in 1982.

Pumping is activated by stepping up and down on treadles which drive pistons, creating cylinder suction that draws groundwater to the surface. Treadle pumps free farmers from dependence on rain-fed irrigation, provide capacity to raise crops in two growing seasons per-year, and help farmers maximize return on their small plots of land. \n\nThere are three different models of iDE Treadle Pumps available: \n\n-The Portable Treadle Pump: Portable models have an inlet pipe that can be extended to surface water or down a well, and can be used for watering up to 1,500 square meters, and its portability allows it to be used for multiple fields.  Treadles, handles and the frame are generally made of steel, but they can be made of local materials (wood or bamboo), as well. \n\n-The Fixed Treadle Pump: The Fixed Treadle Pump is a foot-operated, low-cost option for accessing large quantities of water when the depth to water is less than seven meters. Fixed models are mounted on a well casing and use the casing pipe as the pump support.  Treadles, handles and the frame are generally made of local materials (wood or bamboo). \n\n-The Pressure Treadle Pump: These pumps are especially versatile and can be used for a large variety of irrigating conditions. Most models have an inlet pipe that can be used to draw water from the surface or under ground. Available water output is inversely proportional to the height the pump is lifting the water: the deeper the water, and the higher or further the water is pushed, the less water output is available for the same energy expended. \n\nPump prices, including installation, range between US$20 and $100 based on country of purchase and type of pump.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\niDE is an international non-profit dedicated to ending poverty in the developing world not through handouts, but by helping farm families access the tools and knowledge they need to increase their income.\n\niDE's origins as a formal organization lie in a visit to a Somalian refugee camp in 1982.

Water is poured into the top of the unit and is filtered as it passes through the sand. The raw water is biologically improved partially through predation in the biological or 'schmutzdecke' layer as well as the sand providing a natural mechanical barrier. \n\nThe mould unit is an all steel construction manufactured to a high quality and finish. The main parts of the mould unit are shown in the exploded view below, these are: 1) the puller, 2) an inner mould, and 3) outer mould. The mould is simply bolted together, turned upside down and fitted with a copper outlet pipe. A concrete mix is then poured in the mould and compacted down. After several hours the puller is used to remove the inner mould after which the outer mould can be removed revealing the finished filter shell. The filter is then filled with sand and gravel layers. \n\nContaminated water is poured into the unit at the top. The water passes through the diffuser plate and the sand and gravel layers. Head pressure pushes water through the copper pipe in the base to the outlet point. Biological contamination is reduced through the actions of adsorption; mechanical filtering, predation (‘biological layer’) and natural die off. The actual round concrete BSF units produced are approximately 915mm high with an outer and inner diameter of 355mm and 295mm respectively. The filter depth is approximately 450mm with a surface area of around 0.07m2. The designed flow rate for the filter is around 0.6ltr/minute.\nDesign and production work of the latest round BSF mould is on going at present.\n\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIdeas at Work recognized that the square BSF units typically used within Cambodia were extremely costly and very heavy. To improve this IaW were keen to follow the experience of Medair and their round BSF because of the advantages that this type of unit offered. Typical cost for square filters moulds made by local workshops and other NGO’s have been around $350. To reduce the cost of the roundB SF mould we are  urrently working on utilizing and making modifications to existing moulds used for producing cement pipes (for storm drainage). These basic moulds cost around $85 for the standard mould and are widely available throughout the country and the skills and production facilities for making these are well established. These standard pipe moulds can be modified to allow the base to be sealed off and to add the additional nose cone as standard. The cost of final modified mould is estimated to be around $150 which is less than 50% of the square filter moulds. The amount of concrete used in the round filter is around 20% less as well which provides significant savings on materials costs as well.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Cambodia  \nPrice range (USD): 100 to 200 USD  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 915mm height  x 355mm outer diameter / flow rate 0.6ltr/minute  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.ideas-at-work.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.ideas-at-work.org/IdeasBioSandFilter.html)  \n[round-bio-sand-filter.pdf](/ast/38-round-bio-sand-filter.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Ideas at Work\n\nIdeas at Work  \nPhnom Penh  \nCambodia  \n+855 24 399 577  \n[info@ideas-at-work.org](mailto:info@ideas-at-work.org)  \n\n\n"

It is helping us at illumination to achieve our goal of reducing the energy poverty currently experienced by the world's poorest people, and thereby helping them to have more disposable income, be healthier & safer, and better educated.\n\nKey features of the Mandarin Ultra are:\n> Ultra-bright (40+ lumens from 12 LEDs);\n> Long lasting (6-8 hours on full charge); and\n> Highly reliable and durable (robust design, weather resistant, 1 year warranty).\nIt has been specifically designed to survive everyday use in the harsh conditions of the developing world. The Mandarin Ultra has also been proven on the ground through several years of development and testing across Africa and Asia.\n\nOur Carbon-enabled business model allows illumination to offer such a high quality solar light at super low price point - of course critical when providing to people earning less than $1 a day.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nillumination started in Tanzania in 2010 in a town called Arusha near the base of Mount Kilimanjaro. Our founder, Shane Thatcher, saw the effects that the continual reliance on purchasing kerosene (which accounts for nearly a third of household spend) had on keeping people there trapped in the poverty cycle. From that the Mandarin Ultra was born: a quality solar light that would effectively meet a family's lighting needs, but that was also at a price that was affordable to them.\n\nSince then and with the help of our excellent distribution partners, the Mandarin Ultra's distribution reach has grown quickly across Africa and now into Asia. We have now distributed several hundred thousand lights across over 20 countries.\n\nWhile meeting lighting needs with renewable energy is a key part of reducing energy poverty, we are also developing new products such as renewable energy powered radios, cell phone chargers and more. Our goal is to offer a renewable energy product suite that provides two thirds of household energy needs for less than $30.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: No  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Worldwide  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 11 cm diameter x 2.5 cm high  \nWeight: 220g  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.illuminationsolar.com/)  \n[Product page](http://www.illuminationsolar.com/products/solar-lights/)  \n[illumination-solar-lights-mandarin-ultra-technical-brochure.pdf](/ast/238-illumination-solar-lights-mandarin-ultra-technical-brochure.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: illumination Headquarters Limited\n\nillumination Headquarters Limited  \nTsuen Wan, NT  \nHong Kong  \n[contact@illuminationsolar.com](mailto:contact@illuminationsolar.com)  \n\n\n"

It is elevated a few centimeters from the ground on risers and temporarily fits over an existing latrine hole.  \n\nThere are three different prototypes of the Latrine Training Mat. The prototypes were made of treated wood, temporary plastic, or permanent plastic, with the objective of determining the most acceptable material and design for the mat.  Both wooden and temporary plastic models were designed solely for children, and can be placed on and off the hole as needed. The permanent plastic mat was designed for the whole family to use, but the hole in the center of the mat was approximately 5 cm wider than the other two prototypes.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIn many countries sanitation facilities, such as simple pit latrines, are common and are helpful for maintaining sanitation and preventing illness. However, young children often continue to defecate in the open long after they are old enough to use the latrine, finding open pit latrines intimidating and challenging to use. \n\nIn close partnership with 'Decision Makers' -- the policymakers, practitioners, investors, and donors working with the poor around the world -- IPA designs and evaluates potential solutions to global poverty problems using randomized evaluations, the most rigorous evaluation method available. IPA also mobilizes and supports these 'Decision Makers' to use these solutions to build better programs and policies at scale.

Rural clinics in Nicaragua often lack a constant supply of electricity required to attain the 250°F minimum temperature for sterilization. The student designers at Innovations in International Health (IIH) have designed a solar powered autoclave, dubbed Solarclave, to circumvent this issue and promote safe and healthy practices in rural medicine. A series of mirrors reflects sunlight, concentrating rays of light onto a closed bucket which acts as a \"pressure cooker\". The heat generated inside is well over the required minimum for sterilization; any instruments placed inside the vessel will be sterile and ready for use. The Solarclave's unique design optimally traps the heat reflected by the mirrors, making effective use of materials and time. The parts can be produced using locally-sourced materials (in Nicaragua thus far) and community groups like Las Mujeres Solares have been been trained to quickly assemble these units. The simple assembly also means that the Solarclave can also be transported to other rural clinics for use within the same day.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nInnovations in International Health is based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is composed of students from the Boston area. The Solarclave was developed by Ted Liao and Anna Young, who built a prototype in July 2011 and have been conducting tests in Nicaragua as of October 2011. The team is teaching rural laborers how to build and manufacture the Solarclave, so that IIH may transition into an advisory role in the future. Currently, the Solarclave is being designed for communities in Nicaragua at a cost of about $150 USD. IIH is currently working with clinics in Nicaragua to determine the logistics of storing, maintaining, and sharing the Solarclave.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Nicaragua  \nPrice range (USD): 100 to 200 USD  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Product page](http://iihlab.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/solarclave/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Innovations in International Health\n\nAnna Young, Ted Liao  \nInnovations in International Health  \nCambridge  \n02139  \nUSA  \n[solarautoclave@mit.edu](mailto:solarautoclave@mit.edu)  \n\n\n"

WAPIs are small, handmade devices that tell you when water has reached 146 degrees F, the minimum temperature required for pasteurization. Once pasteurized, water is microbe-free and safe to drink. Water-borne illnesses cause diarrhea, which one of the leading causes of death in the developing world. Children are more susceptible than adults to such bacterial infections. Typically, water is left out in the sun or placed in a solar cooker to reach critical pasteurization temperature. Without a thermometer though, it is impossible to know if that water is truly safe to drink. The WAPI contains a slab of soy wax that melts at precisely the same temperature at which water is pasteurized. If the wax is solid, the water is not ready; when the wax has liquefied and collected at the base of the WAPI, the water is ready. The device fits in your pocket and is attached to a string for retrieval after purification. The simple design allows anyone to use it, while reinforcing the idea that water must be adequately boiled before consumption. WAPIs are reusable and can be assembled from spare manufacturing parts or kits.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe Rotary Clubs of Fresno and Pacific Grove in California assemble WAPIs, distribute them around the world, and also offer WAPI-building kits from their website. They offer both “original” WAPIs, which use a PVC pipe frame, and a new WAPI that incorporates a stainless-steel wiring system. Both models are extremely effective. Each kit contains enough materials to construct 200 WAPIs.  The website also contains highly detailed instructions on how to build your own WAPI, and where to find its component materials.

Once a mosquito has been identified, a trained laser delivers photonic energy to kill or incapacitate it.  Designed for use in developing regions, the photonic fence will be used to complement bed nets, insecticides, and other existing vector control techniques. \n\nOne potential use of the Photonic Fence is to create a virtual fence that detects insects as they cross its plane. When an invading insect is detected, custom software is able to estimate the insect’s size and also to measure its wing beat frequency. Using this method, not only can the system distinguish between mosquitoes, butterflies, and bumblebees, but it can also determine whether a mosquito is male or female, as only female mosquitoes bite humans.\n\nOnce the software establishes that the insect is a valid target, it tracks the mosquito in flight, runs a safety check to ensure no innocent bystanders are in view, and then activates a laser to zap the mosquito. The Photonic Fence could be set along the perimeter of clinics or other strategic areas to control mosquitoes without endangering humans or other animals.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nA working prototype is still being tested, however in the future this solution will be beneficial for hospitals and clinics.

A treadle pump can be used by all members of a farming family to irrigate crops. The user stands on two treadles, usually made of bamboo, and pedals them. This light exercise, similar to using a step machine, operates two metal pump-cylinders which are connected to a tube-well, or to a surface level pond. The tube-well consists of robust, flexible plastic, sunk into the ground until it reaches an aquifer. Before first use, water is poured into the cylinders to ‘prime’ the pump. When the user pedals, water is lifted up onto the field, or into a pond or irrigation canal. The pedalling action is easily mastered and not strenuous, so that anyone in the family can take a turn at irrigating the fields. Typically the household will operate a pump for between two and eight hours per day, often in the early morning or evening when the weather is cool.\n\nDirect impacts of Treadle Pump irrigation\n\n - The income impact of the Treadle Pump technology varies across households and regions, but US$400 per year is the estimate of the average increase in the annual net income of each household\n\n- It frees the farmer from the limitations of rain fed farming and raises his capacity to grow crops in both winter and summer\n\n - Land augmenting : For the poor farmers constrained by the small size of the landholdings, treadle pump technology acts as a land augmenting intervention. With the use of Treadle Pump the farmers can cultivate all the year round thus increasing their cropping intensity to 200-300%.\n\n - Easy and productive : The Treadle pump is easier to use and is more productive than a variety of traditional manual irrigation devices. Its output is in the range of 4000-4500 litres/hour with a lift of 4-7 m.\n\n- Change in cropping pattern : Treadle Pump technology enables the farmers to grow crops they were not able to grow earlier, example- farmers are able to grow vegetables and make more money by selling them\n\n- The most significant impact is the increase in the crop yield\n\n- Among the most important reason cited by farmers themselves is the leaching away of the fertilizers due to the strong water currents generated by the diesel pumps (traditionally used by farmers for irrigation during non-monsoon seasons)\n\n - Farming families have a better diet with more vegetables and milk, and plenty of surplus produce to sell\n\n- Acumen Fund survey showed that helping with pumping did not add to chores of children or prevent them attending school\n\n- TUV Nord has verified greenhouse gas savings from avoided diesel as 0.477 tonnes/year CO2 per pump.\n\n\n---- #summary ----\n\nIDEI has designed an irrigation solution that is both easy to use and versatile. The portable KB Treadle Pump utilizes parts made of bamboo and plastic tubing and is activated by foot pedals. The simple design allows farmers to take advantage of new water sources, and increase their annual crop yield. Its output is in the range of 4000-4500 litres/hour with a lift of 4-7 m.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIEDI does not sell equipment directly to farmers but rather is responsible for setting up supply chains in rural areas, marketing the KB Treadle Pump, providing quality control of the supply chain, and the training of manufacturers, dealers and installation mechanics. \n\nIEDI facilitates the sale of different models of the treadle pump to small and marginal farm families in the eastern zone of India. Since inception in 1991, they have ensured the adoption of around 750,000 treadle pumps by small holder farm families. \n\nA number of assessment and socio-economic impact studies carried out in different regions of program implementation in India, have captured the changing roles of women and altered gender relations with the use of technology. Women have reported improved sense of ownership, confidence, and an increased ability to provide for the families nutritional needs besides the new acquired knowledge and new skills like proper crop spacing, fertilizer application, disease and control.\n\nThe tribal women have shifted their roles from being wage laborers to independent farmers with keen and vigorous farming interests and increased time flexibilities. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://ide-india.org/)  \n[Product page](http://ide-india.org/BambooTreadlePump.aspx)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://ashdenawards.blogspot.com/2009/12/developing-countries-need-appropriate.html)  \n[idei-case-study-2009.pdf](/ast/67-idei-case-study-2009.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: International Development Enterprises India (IDEI)\n\nAmitabha  Sadangi  \nInternational Development Enterprises India (IDEI)  \nNew Delhi   \n110016  \nIndia  \n+91 11 4600 0400  \n[mailbox@ide-india.org](mailto:mailbox@ide-india.org)  \n\n\n"

They lose the ability to speak because of various conditions: cerebral palsy, autism, mental retardation, strokes, motor neuron disease, and many others.\n\nMost non-verbal people are intelligent, aware and sensitive. But because communication is the bedrock of social interaction, their ability to integrate into mainstream society remains limited.\nAll over the world, there has been a concerted effort to develop and use Assistive Technologies to help non-verbal people communicate. These tools are called Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices. In most developed countries, such tools have become a part of life for non-verbal people. But not in India.\n\nWe developed Avaz between 2007 and 2010, working closely with the folks at Vidya Sagar and other special needs schools in the country. As our thoughts began taking shape, we decided that we did not want to just create a technological device – we wanted to create an artificial voice. And so, when  we designed Avaz, we wanted to give it all of the features that we (who are verbal) take for granted.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nAvaz was designed and commercialized by Invention Labs, a start-up based out of the IIT Madras Research Park in Chennai and started by alumni of IIT Madras.

The planter is able to plant maize seeds and precise quantities of fertilizer through surface mulch in all soil types and conditions. \n\nThe design of the tool uses body weight to operate a foot pedal in order to supply the energy needed to create two slots through the Earth's surface layer in a gradual manner, combined with a forward/backward rocking motion. Precise quantities of seed and fertilizer are dropped by hand into two funnels, which deposit the seeds into two separate holes in the soil. The resulting precision of seed and fertilizer placement requires about half the normal recommended quantities of seed and fertilizer to be used, allowing for considerable economic savings for smallholder farmers.\n\nThis development was initiated by observing the poor performance of other Conservation Agriculture planting tools that averaged $80 USD in cost. In comparison, the Manual Precision Seed planter can be manufactured locally by metal workers for roughly $15 USD.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nCrop yields are diminishing in Sub Saharan Africa due to excessive cultivation, reduced organic content of soil and desertification.  When combined with crop rotation, Conservation Agriculture techniques are proven to reverse these trends by minimizing soil disturbance and maintaining an organic surface layer. \n\nPlanting seeds and fertilizer through this organic surface layer is a challenge among small-scale farmers. The hand/foot planter was designed to help women farmers overcome this challenge.

Skin-to-skin contact between the baby's front and the mother's chest: Skin-to-skin contact should ideally start at birth, but is helpful at any time. It should ideally be continuous day and night, but shorter periods are still helpful. \n2. Exclusive breastfeeding: for an average mother, direct suckling by the baby from the breasts is all that is needed. For very premature babies, milk and additional essential nutrients may be needed. \n3. Support of the dyad: whatever is needed for the medical, emotional, psychological and physical well-being of mother and baby is provided to them without separating them.

A consumer purchases the light and battery components of the solar lamp while the shop owner keeps the solar panel. They commence their \"rent to own\" program. 3. After enjoying an evening of bright, clean light and phone-charging, the consumer returns and pays for a fully-charged battery (the extra battery). They must return because the solar panel is the only way to recharge the battery. 4.

At some point during the trip, my Aunt told me that her daughter (my cousin) was having trouble with \"unit conversion\" which was not allowing her to be placed in the more advanced math track for 7th grade. Nadia was clearly a very bright girl, so I made a deal with her. I'd remotely tutor her for an hour after work as long as she was willing to do any extra work I gave her.\n\nI began remotely tutoring Nadia in August of 2004. She was in New Orleans--where I also grew up-- so we used a telephone to talk and Yahoo Doodle as a shared notepad. Nadia ended up catching up and getting ahead of her class so I started tutoring her brothers, Arman and Ali, as well. Eventually, word got around and I was remotely tutoring and handful of cousins and family friends. Scheduling around my work, their soccer practice, and the different time zones became a little ridiculous, so I started to make YouTube videos for them to watch in their own time, at their own pace.\n\nIt didn't take long to see that other students (including adult learners) were hungry for videos like these so I kept going!\n\nEven before I made the videos, I started writing simple Javascript problem generators so that my cousins would never run out of practice problems. I wanted to know when and how they were doing the problems, so I added a database to track usage. 70 modules and 10,000 lines of code later (much of which has made the software adaptive), it has morphed into the adaptive assessment exercises on our site.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Free  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Product page](http://www.khanacademy.org/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Khan Academy\n\nSalman Khan  \nKhan Academy  \nMountain View, CA  \n94042  \n[info@khanacademy.org](mailto:info@khanacademy.org)  \n\n\n"

Called the “Mafuta Mali” (meaning “oil wealth” in Kiswahili), it was based on an original “ram press” design by Carl Bielenberg but was designed to be more efficient, durable and profitable to use. KickStart also developed and designed the first Gravity Bucket Filter to go with the press and developed a complete set of tooling for local mass production of both the press and filter.

They need hard cash to buy enough food and to pay for school fees and healthcare. Yet most live on farms less than two acres in size\n\nMany thousands of entrepreneurial farmers are now irrigating with KickStart's manual MoneyMaker  irrigation pumps and changing their small subsistence farms into vibrant new commercial enterprises. With irrigation they can grow and sell as many as three to four high value vegetable crops every year, and ensure that the crop is ready for market when the price is high.\n\nThese “farmerpreneurs” are increasing their incomes by as much as ten-fold and making as much as 400,000 shillings ($5400) profit per year. KickStart’s low cost micro-irrigation pumps are transforming subsistence farms into highly profitable enterprises.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nKickStart’s Original MoneyMaker pump was introduced in September 1996. This small treadle operated pump could pull water from as deep as 23 feet (7m) and be used to furrow irrigate up to two acres of land. \n\nOver 4,050 Original MoneyMaker pumps were sold. They are still being used to generate over $3.9 million in new profits and wages every year and they proved the potential of micro-irrigation in East Africa. However, this pump can only pull water from a well or pond and dump it into an irrigation furrow – it cannot push the water thru a hosepipe or up a hill. It soon became clear that Kenyan farmers preferred to irrigate with a hosepipe or sprinklers and wanted to pump water up to their fields on the sides of hills. So in October 1998 KickStart introduced the new Super-MoneyMaker Pump and this new suction and pressure pump superseded the original and the Original MoneyMaker was taken off the market in February 1999.\n\nThe Super MoneyMaker Pressure Pump was launched in October 1998, in response to a demand by farmers for a pump that can push water uphill as well as simply pulling it up from the source. This means it is suitable for use on steeply sloping land where the water source may be at the bottom. Thousands use it to pump water from hand-dug wells, rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. It is ideal for sprinkler irrigation, filling overhead water tanks, or for use with nozzles and sprays attached to the end of the delivery hose. This powerful pump can draw water up from 23 feet (7m) and has a total pumping head of 46 feet (14m). It can be used to irrigate up to 2 acres of land.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: no  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.kickstart.org/)  \n[Product page](http://www.kickstart.org/products/super-moneymaker/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: KickStart International\n\nKickStart International  \nSan Francisco, CA   \n94109-1600  \nUSA  \n1-(415) 346-4820  \n[info@kickstart.org](mailto:info@kickstart.org)  \n\n\n"

At this relatively small size, this refrigerator can hold over 70,000 polio vaccines. In the hot climate of rural Nigeria, it is important to keep these vaccines cooled to 3 degrees celsius to prevent degradation. KXN Nigeria Ltd. provides rural health centers with a solar PV module, battery, and charge controller along with this refrigerator. The refrigerator consumes an average of 03.kWh of electricity per day, and the lead-acid solar batter is designed to withstand the unique discharging cycles required by the unit.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nKXN Nigeria Ltd. had already distributed 720 refrigeration systems by May of 2007. The largest concentration of their units is in the Kebbi State of Nigeria, with 477 units installed. The systems are in the higher price range of 6,000 pounds (or 1,440,000 Nigerian Naira). The refrigerators can, however, hold up to 3,000 pounds worth of vaccines. A proportion of the purchases were supported by the National Programme for Immunisation and Rotary International Nigeria PolioPlus. In the Borno State of Nigeria alone, an estimate 37,500 children under the age have been vaccinated every year since the installation of these refrigerators. Local solar technicians are also trained by KXN to maintain and repair the refrigerators on a regular basis.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Nigeria  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.solarsolve.com/about_us.php)  \n[Product page](http://www.solarsolve.com/products.php)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: KXN Nigeria, Ltd.\n\nKXN Nigeria, Ltd.  \nLagos  \nNigeria  \n+2342671413  \n[anthonyighodaro@solarsolve.com](mailto:anthonyighodaro@solarsolve.com)  \n\n\n"

In ECAR, or ElectroChemical Arsenic Remediation, ordinary steel plates use low voltage electricity to produce iron oxide (e.g. rust) particles in water that adsorb and trap arsenic. During the process, arsenite (which is more toxic and difficult to remove) is converted into arsenate, allowing the process to be highly effective under robust conditions. Treated water exceeds international WHO standards for arsenic and iron across many groundwater sources. The electrodes are cleaned by reversing the current, making operation and maintenance simple and non-hazardous. The technology was designed to work within a sustainable service delivery model that can cover the cost of an electricity source and still sell arsenic-safe water at a locally affordable price while simultaneously covering all costs.\n\nThe requirements for maintenance are low and electrode passivation can be limited by reversing voltage regularly. Operating ECAR is simple and non-hazardous: voltage is very low (about 3 V DC) and no corrosive chemicals are needed. ECAR can be operated by trained local community members.  \n\nOperating costs are extremely low (~ 0.04 USD/l), making it possible to sell the arsenic-safe water at a locally affordable price while simultaneously covering the expenses.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://gadgillab.berkeley.edu)  \n[Product page](http://gadgillab.berkeley.edu/research/water/arsenic_removal/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Lawrence Berkeley National Lab/USA\n\nLawrence Berkeley National Lab/USA  \nBerkeley, CA  \nUnited States  \n[Contact](http://gadgillab.berkeley.edu/contact/)  \n\n\n"

All Lazarian building designs have a 20-25 R-Value and an Economic Life of 40-50 years. The wall systems of the homes comprise Lazarian polystyrene (EPS) foam blocks, concrete and steel rebar, a sustainable solution to cost effective, energy efficient housing for the needy. When the economic life of the Lazarian home is complete, approximately 90% of the home may be recycled, including the Lazarian EPS foam blocks, concrete, rebar, metal roofing, and wood. In places where use of wood is not available or desirable, roof truss systems may be built with recyclable steel angle iron or aluminum. Lazarian World Homes are simple and inexpensive to build. With minimum training, families are able to build their own homes. On-site Instruction is provided by Lazarian staff. Because the walls of a completed Lazarian home have cells filled with concrete and steel reinforcing bar, the resulting structure inside the walls of a Lazarian building is commonly referred to as Reinforced Concrete Post and Beam Construction. This is one of the strongest methods of construction known to structural engineers. Lazarian homes will withstand major earthquakes, storms and natural disasters. The walls are waterproof and are easily cleaned after a flood.

The Prime Radio is the next generation of power independent, multi-band radio to provide 24/7 listening access - anytime, anywhere.\n\nAn analogue radio with FM, AM and three SW bands, the Prime features an attractive digital LCD screen, enabling accurate tuning for even hard to find stations. Station frequencies are displayed in a large, clear, easy-to-read format. A color-coded user interface, with only three buttons and one knob, makes it easy to understand for children and adults alike.\n\nThe Prime features a suite of power options – a solar panel, a hand crank, and a DC input which can be plugged into either a wall socket or a car battery. The solar panel, which slides onto the back of the radio, can charge the Prime directly through a cable, or removed and charged wirelessly. The wireless solar panel, an upgraded option, has a powerful, rechargeable battery pack, which provides additional battery capacity and extends playtime.\n\nThe upgraded solar panel also includes a USB output socket, enabling mobile phone charging on demand. There is an additional cost for this, but it will pay for itself in no time by charging phones. Given the lack of electricity in rural areas, charging mobile phones can be a challenge. This solar panel model comes with a USB lead and two standard charging port tips. Mobile charging by USB leads will become more common as phone manufacturers are now standardizing tips.\n\nWhen charging the Prime with the hand-crank in either direction, a green indicator light shines to let the user know that they are winding at optimum speed. If you wind it too slowly, now you’ll know to speed up.\n\nThe Prime’s powerful speaker makes it ideal for group listening in classrooms, marketplaces, or in community meetings. Radio distance education classes in countries like Malawi, Southern Sudan and Zambia can have more than 100 learners gathered around one radio. To cater for this, there is an auxiliary speaker output socket, allowing for additional speakers to be plugged in, boosting listening volume.\n\nThe Prime has an integrated LED light that is pushed to activate. It provides a bright light at night, or in unlit classrooms that can aid in reading or help teachers to grade papers.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nSome of the team that brought you the Lifeline radio also designed and developed the Prime, under the direction of our new product development and trading arm, Lifeline Technologies Trading Ltd. Like with the Lifeline radio in 2002, we listened to what end-users told us they wanted.

Both lights are equipped with a dimmer switch, which allows them to operate in either high brightness or low brightness mode. \n\nThe 5-watt solar panels are extremely durable and rated for approximately 80% of initial output after 20 years. Each solar panel comes with three meters of cable such that they can be mounted in the most effective locations possible. At the ends of these cables are connectors which plug directly into the charge controller, which is responsible for regulating the system and cutting it off once the battery voltage drops to 12 volts. After shutting down, the charge controller permits the lights to operate again after the panel has brought the voltage of the battery back up to 12.4 volts. This action of the charge controller simply prolongs the lifespan of the battery, and ensures that the system is functioning at its maximum capacity.\n\nThe only part of the system that will require regular replacement is the battery. Based on the system's design, the battery may last, on average, for two years if it fully discharged everyday. 12V/7Ah sealed lead acid batteries are available in many countries.\n\nWhen the system is fully charged, it can provide up to 9 lamp hours per day on full brightness (4.5 hours per lamp) or up to 28 lamp hours of light using the dim function (these estimates are based on 4.8 peak sun hours (PSH). Please contact a LUTW representative for PSH estimations for your location). The ability of the system to fully recharge also depends on the air temperature and humidity where the system is installed.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nLight up the World (LUTW) is the first international humanitarian organization dedicated to illuminating the lives of the world's poor by providing affordable, safe, healthy, efficient, and environmentally responsible lighting.\n\nIn 1997, Dr. Dave Irvine-Halliday, a Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Calgary, had the vision to use LED lighting to bring practical, economical, and environmentally safe lighting to the developing world. While on sabbatical in Nepal, Dave visited local villages and was struck by the poor conditions of the people. Most of them were relying on kerosene lamps which produced little light and filled the homes with dangerous smoke. As the annual income of the Nepalese villagers averaged $200 USD, Dr. Irvine-Halliday realized that there was a great need for simple, safe, healthy, affordable and rugged lighting.\n\nDave had been working with LEDs for more than two decades, and spent most of 1997 and 1998 trying to make an acceptable white light from various combinations of colored indicator LEDs. He made white light but it was simply not bright enough to be of any practical use in the developing world. Nichia, a Japanese company, had invented a bright White LED a few years earlier and Dave immediately requested samples. The 'eureka' moment occurred when Dave lit his first White Light Emitting Diode. \n\nIn 1999, Dr. Irvine-Halliday and his wife, Jenny, tested their prototype WLED lamps in a number of Nepali villages and the response from the villagers was so absolutely positive that they knew what they'd be doing with the rest of their lives.  In 2000, they returned to Kathmandu and with the assistance of their Nepali friend, Muni Raj Upadhyaya, lit the first four villages in the world with WLED lighting, thus laying the pioneering origins for the development of LUTW into a global lighting initiative.\n\nTogether with Ken Robertson, Roy Moore and Pauline Cummings, Light Up The World was  established as a legal entity in 2002. From a singular idea born among the poor, LUTW has grown into a global humanitarian organization reaching out to even the remotest areas of the world.\n\nThrough generous support from interested individuals, corporations, host country organizations, international foundations and industrial partners, LUTW has brought light to more than 25,000 homes in 51 different countries throughout the developing world from Afghanistan to Zambia. Over 300,000 people have been impacted directly by this new and innovative approach to development.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nAvailable online: yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Contact manufacturer  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.lutw.org/)  \n[Product page](http://lutw.org/how-we-work/technology/)  \n[model-i-technical-information-100208.pdf](/ast/85-model-i-technical-information-100208.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Light Up the World\n\nLight Up the World  \nCalgary, AB  \nT2R 0K2  \nCanada  \n403-266-5004   \n[lutw@lutw.org](mailto:lutw@lutw.org)  \n\n\n"

This source of light is based on a solar bottle, is easy to install and requires only simple technology and accessible materials. \n\nTo create the light, a plastic bottle is filled with water and some chlorine to keep the water clean. Then, a hole  is made in the roof of the household to install the bottle - half outside half inside. The daylight that enters from above gets diffracted by the water and spreads the light into the room. During the day, it substitutes a 55 watt light bulb completely. \n\nThe solution also works when the sky is clouded. The bottle will shine less brightly, but there is still enough light getting inside the bottle. The impact of installing these solar bulbs goes beyond providing light, as it can help improve quality of life for families by creating extended indoor working hours while reducing households' carbon footprints. \n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIn developing regions, the lack of light inside people’s homes can be a major issue. The shelters in these areas are mostly built so close to one another that even rooms with windows lack sunlight. Without a source of light, performing even basic tasks becomes very difficult. Liter of Light is simple enough for everybody to learn how to build. As a result, it can also create jobs for people in slums.

In this way, residents can access the information repeatedly and when they need to apply it. When they are ill, pregnant, or cultivating land for a particular crop, information is readily available.\n\nAdditionally, the Talking Book enables teachers to reach more students in over-crowded classrooms. Teachers record readings of instructional materials like textbooks, stories, the alphabet onto a Talking Book. They also create interactive audio lessons such as multiple choice quizzes, audio hyperlinks, interactive games suited to the needs of their students.

Iron deficiency can lead to the weakening of the immune system and cognitive impairment in developmental stages towards children and pregnant women. The iron fish was made to defend against this ailment.\n\nThe fish, slightly acidified by lemon juice, only needs to be placed in the pot when water is boiling or cooking. The iron will be naturally released into the food or water that the villagers consume. This has halved the incidences of clinical anemia and increased the circulation of iron. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nSince iron deficiency is most prominent in South-East Asian areas, Dr. Charles built his research base in that region. The product targets mainly Cambodia, which has a 44% population rate of acquiring anemia from the Cambodian Demographic and Health Survey (2010). The first set of trials was unsuccessful but the second of trials after further improvements where the fish was used everyday for nine months, proved to be positive and women’s iron levels rose significantly. The positive effects of the Iron Fish are not just retained to health benefits but also towards the economical and social respects of Cambodia. The Lucky Iron Fish is currently partnered with multiple NGO’s in Cambodia for distribution of the fish. The fish is made by scrap metals from local metal workers, which stimulates small businesses across Cambodia.  \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Cambodia  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: Size of a Bar of Soap  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](https://luckyironfish.com/)  \n[Product page](https://luckyironfish.com/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: The Lucky Iron Fish\n\nChristopher Charles  \nThe Lucky Iron Fish  \nGuelph  \nCanada  \n[c.charles@luckyironfish.com](mailto:c.charles@luckyironfish.com)  \n\n\n"

It serves as a principal vehicle for micro-enterprises, while providing local communities or social institutions with high-quality nutrition. Operating without the need for any electricity supply or generator, it uses locally-available fuels - including wood, biomass or bottled gas - for operation.\n\nThe full system includes three components: \n\n-The PedalPro system which performs the grinding function for soybeans and other foods, as well as pedal-operated battery charging and water pumping\n-A stainless steel pressure-cooking vessel and a stainless steel filter press\n-A pressurized stainless steel steam boiler\n\nThe use of steam-injected pressure-cooking is up to ten times more energy-efficient than traditional open stove cooking. Some foods can also be prepared using only the pedal-operated grinder/blender, and do not require the boiler and pressure-cooker. A standalone electric grinder is also an available component for the VitaGoat system. The electric grinder can be ordered at the same time as the system or purchased at a later date. \n\nThe VitaGoat can process economical, high-protein and healthy soya foods in the form of soy milk, and its derivatives such as tofu and yogurt. Other cooked and processed foods such as soups, sauces and purees, can be made from various fruits and vegetables. An extra food-preserving vessel is in development to allow for long shelf-life.

Wherever there is a site that is unattended, remote and exposed the FM910-3 can be relied on to deliver power quietly and efficiently. Professional applications such as monitoring, telemetry, communications, isolated agricultural sites, navigation aids, military field applications, rural street lighting and remote homes or year round mobile home installations are all established uses for the FM910-3 Windcharger.\n\nThe Furlmatic design includes a protective “furling” device in its tail system.  This yaws the turbine at an angle to the prevailing wind at windspeeds above 35mph (15m/s) thus reducing the speed of the turbine and protecting it from the forces of excessive winds and reducing stresses on the turbine and tower.  This is a very simple but effective design perfected by us many years ago and subsequently emulated by others.\n\nThe Furlmatic FM910-3 Windcharger is a quiet, discreet windcharger that can replace the need to install grid power and even enable the use of appliances at remote locations previously considered unfeasible owing to high grid installation costs.  It is an affordable energy solution that is easy to install and requires only the very minimum of annual inspection/maintenance.

This software helps to create an effective supply chain for hospital equipment by:\n\n1) Enabling hospital technicians to systematize equipment repairs.\n2) Providing information about existing equipment needs to equipment-donating NGOs and the Ministry of Health (MOH).\n3) Enabling the MOH and MED International to evaluate the effectiveness of equipment donations and repair processes.\n\nFirst piloted in Zanzibar, technicians repaired $300,000 USD in equipment with less than €500 in spare parts. This corresponded to a 23% increase in the use of life-saving equipment with inpatient procedures and premature infants, along with a 30% increase in equipment utilization. MiEMS is currently used in Zanzibar and Tanzania. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nMany developing regions lack a sufficient supply of critically needed medical equipment because broken machines are rarely repaired while needs for additional equipment go unmet. \n\nThis often occurs because hospitals do not maintain up-to-date inventories. Administrators are thus unable to communicate their institutions' equipment needs to international NGOs. As a result, donated equipment is often irrelevant to the clinical setting. Machines remain un-repaired because there is no established system to report and manage equipment breakdowns. With limited information about the location of broken equipment, equipment technicians work ineffectively, repairing equipment in an ad hoc manner rather than prioritizing critical repairs. \n\nLiterature from the World Health Organization (WHO) states that healthcare interventions that include a software management program are 2.64 times more likely to create positive health outcomes in patients than those without similar programs. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Tanzania  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.medinternational-us.org/index.html)  \n[Product page](http://www.medinternational-us.org/solutions.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: MED International \n\nHan Sheng Chia  \nMED International   \nZanzibar  \nTanzania  \n[hschia@medinternational-us.org](mailto:hschia@medinternational-us.org)  \n\n\n"

This measurement allows health professionals to ensure phototherapy units are working correctly, and determine when a phototherapy device, or its bulb, needs to be replaced.\n\nThe Lightmeter was developed for use with the MTTS Firefly and MTTS Overhead Phototherapy V3000, but it can be used for any phototherapy unit with LEDs, fluorescent bulbs or compact bulbs. When measuring a single-sided phototherapy machine, the Lightmeter will measure the light using the front sensor. When measuring a double-sided phototherapy, the MTTS Lightmeter reads the intensity from both sides, using the sensors on the front and back of the device. It then displays the sum of the values from each side.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nMTTS was established in 2004 with the goal of delivering innovative, cost-effective solutions for newborns in need of intensive medical care.

The device has the additional advantages of being robust, portable and transparent to users. A corn sheller can be made at a fraction of the cost of market alternatives.\n\nThe D-Lab program at MIT, in collaboration with their community partners, has developed several versions of the maize sheller that can be made using locally available materials and methods.  The process requires only a hammer, pliers and a tool to cut the sheet metal into the appropriate size to accommodate the local varieties of maize.\n\nA corn sheller can be made by forming ridges on a curved piece of sheet metal.  It can also  be made by using a straight piece of sheet metal with tapered ridges to produce a similar surface. A simple jig was also developed for making these shellers quickly and easily (see link to additional documentation, below).\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nMaize (corn) is one of the most important staple crops in the world. In Kenya, for example, 45% of the population considers Ugali (maize meal) to be their survival food, making it the most consumed food of the country. Maize also accounts for 43% of the Latin American diet. In Asia, maize production is over 200 billion kilograms a year and it is expected that the total maize production in developing countries will eventually overtake production in industrialized countries.\n\nIn many rural areas of developing countries, maize kernels are removed from the cob by hand in a process called shelling. Shelling the annual maize harvest by hand typically takes weeks and may pull children out of school, since processing food for survival takes priority over education in subsistence farming households. The hardened, dry maize can also be painful to shell and lead to hand injuries.\n\nExisting alternatives to shelling maize by hand are often unaffordable or difficult to obtain for subsistence farmers. An estimated 550 million small- holder farmers in the world lack access to mechanized agricultural technology.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Free  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://d-lab.mit.edu/resources)  \n[Product page](https://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/CornSheller_DoIt.pdf)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](https://d-lab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/CornShellerJig_DoIt.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: MIT D-Lab\n\nMIT D-Lab  \nCambridge, MA  \n02139  \nUnited States  \n+1 617-253-5985  \n[d-lab@mit.edu](mailto:d-lab@mit.edu)  \n\n\n"

The resulting images, which are owned by the residents, are georeferenced and stitched into maps which are 100x higher resolution that those offered by Google, at extremely low cost. In some cases these maps may be used to support residents’ claims to land title. By creating open-source tools to include everyday people in exploring and defining their own geography, Warren hopes to enable a diverse set of alternative agendas and practices, and to emphasize the fundamentally narrative and subjective aspects of mapping over its use as a medium of control.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Free  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes, this is largely a do-it-yourself solution  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.grassrootsmapping.org)  \n[Product page](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/balloon-mapping)  \n[grassroots-mapping-english-2-0.pdf](/ast/110-grassroots-mapping-english-2-0.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: MIT Media Lab\n\nJeffrey Warren  \nMIT Media Lab  \nCambridge, MA  \nUSA  \n617.253.0365  \n[warren@mit.edu](mailto:warren@mit.edu)  \n\n\n"

Konbit bridges the communication gap. Haitians can call the toll-tree number and make a recording of their skills and availability. Crowd-sourced volunteers translate and transcribe the messages in any language the NGO can use.

A vertical axis water wheel is mounted in the center of a circular tube. Induced by the flow of a river, the wheel turns like a turbine. The rotational energy is transferred by the axis to a wheel where several conventional bicycle dynamos transform the kinetic energy into electricity. \n\nThe rotor is fixed to the embankment, a bridge or something similar by mooring ropes. The rotor prototype consists of a tractor tire tube, a flat bar steel as frame construction, bicycle dynamos and sheet metal blades. All required materials can be sourced locally worldwide. A flow speed of 1.5m/s can provide an output of up to 150W.\n\nAn online-Do-It-Yourself manual offers a variety of possible materials to be used. Moreover, an affordable pre-fabricated construction kit which includes the important parts, e.g. tire tube, blade profiles, canvas cover and a specific generator is being developed. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nAccording to figures published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), 1.4 billion people lack regular access to electrical energy. Over 2.5 billion people rely on traditional biomass for cooking. Access to electrical power plays a significant role in improving living conditions.

This mold is filled with an aerated mortar that is approved by the South African Bureau of Standards to form the wall of the house in as little as one day. Each mold can produce about one house per-day, with labor supplied by approximately 16 unskilled workers. Each mold can be used 50 times and then recycled to make toilets, sinks, etc. \n\nThe process involves a number of smaller components. These components are assembled into larger, lightweight panels, which are configured into a mold which forms a house of any desired size and design. The panels are then removed the next morning and immediately re-erected onto an adjoining site. The result is a wall with an off-shutter finish that requires no plastering, beam filling or chasing, and produces no waste. \n\nMoladi has simplified its construction technology so it can be used by unemployed and unskilled workers. Using the formwork, one square meter of wall can be produced for approximately $7 USD. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe multi-award winning Moladi construction system was founded in 1986 in South Africa as a method of building cast structures, rather than reinforced monolithic structures.

The solution is composed of non-toxic nanoparticles that are custom synthesized for each vaccine. When the vaccine is combined with the polymer, vaccine spoilage is prevented without the need for refrigeration. Nanoly's solution is designed to eliminate the difficulties associated with vaccine transportation and delivery. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe vaccine “cold chain” is the system of transporting and storing vaccines within the temperature range of 35°F (2°C) to 45°F (8°C) (US Department of Health and Human Services). If exposed to temperatures too high or too low, vaccines will denature and become inactive. This strict vaccine refrigeration requirement contributes to the over 25% liquid vaccine wastage rate estimated by the World Health Organization. The process also hinders the delivery of vaccines to remote areas of the world where there is no electricity to operate refrigerators. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: product still in development  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.nanoly.info/)  \n[Product page](http://www.nanoly.info/)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2013/09/11/nanoly-bioscience-develop-cu-boulder-vaccine-stabilization-technology)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Nanoly Bioscience, Inc.\n\nNanoly Bioscience, Inc.  \nBoulder, Colorado  \nUnited States  \n[nanxi@nanoly.info](mailto:nanxi@nanoly.info)  \n\n\n"

In remote parts of India, specifically in the states of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, kerosene is unavailable. If available, it is sold to the poor at exorbitant black market rates, sometimes upwards of 70 rupees per liter (a 2005 estimate). Lighting kerosene in homes is also unsafe because of noxious fumes as well the risk of fire in homes that have thatched roofs. The Aishwarya lamp, designed by Noble Energy Solar Technologies, is a solar-powered lamp that provides significantly more light than a kerosene lamp. The lantern has a life of over 10 years, and the battery must be replaced every 3 years to guarantee longevity of the product. Rather than repair the product upon damage, NEST has designed it so that key parts can be replaced for an inexpensive fee. The lantern utilizes a 3 W compact fluorescent lamp, specially manufactured for this application.\n\nIt is currently being sold in remote and poor villages in India, through dealerships that are trained by NEST. These lanterns are affordable through a payment plan that allows individual dealers and sub-dealers, who know their customers. Because of this personal relationship with customers, villagers pay on a monthly installment plan over 8 or 16 month periods (200 or 100 rupees a month). Based on their size, dealerships sell anywhere from 500 - 1000 lanterns a year, with only 3-4% of customers defaulting on payments.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nMr DT Barki founded NEST in 1998 after seeing the fatal results of a kerosene-lamp fire in a house. Since then, he and NEST have been committed to replacing kerosene lamps with PV lanterns that eliminate harmful and toxic emissions typically associated with burning kerosene. Furthermore, the sale of the Aishwarya lantern in villages has employed a number of people as dealers (including a handful of women), and has also allowed villagers to increase earning by giving them a safe and well-lit environment to work in. The power of the Aishwarya light is almost five times that of a traditional kerosene lamp, thus enabling children to study and read after dark. The product won an Ashden Award in 2005 for its creative design as well as its feasible payment strategy. Since then, NEST has used its award support to further publicize the Aishwarya lantern, and to fund research into more efficient PV systems.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India  \nLocal Price: 1600 rupees  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.solarnest.net/)  \n[Product page](http://www.solarnest.net/lanterns.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Noble Energy Solar Technologies, Ltd.\n\nDT Barki  \nNoble Energy Solar Technologies, Ltd.  \nBegumpet Hyderabad  \n500 016  \nIndia  \n+91 040 2776 2559  \n[dtbarki@usa.net](mailto:dtbarki@usa.net)  \n\n\n"

Each Wood Mold can produce 50-60 filters depending on the type of wood used and assuming proper care and maintenance. Other features of the Wood Mold include:- Inexpensive: ($50-80 USD per-mold)- Lightweight (approx. 60 pounds)- Locally sourced materials (all materials are purchased in-country and are easily replaced)- Easy to use (no construction experience or specialized tools required)- Can be made off-grid\n\nIn order to create the BioSand filter, concrete is poured into the Wood Mold and allowed to cure overnight. The mold form is then removed, leaving the body of the filter, which is the device that households receive in order to purify their water. \n\nBioSand Filters (BSFs) use natural biological processes, sand, and gravel to make contaminated water safe for drinking. Water is poured into the top of the filter and as it moves through various layers of the filter, pathogens and harmful bacteria are filtered out. BSFs are an ideal water filtration solution because they are durable, can be made with local materials and are easy to use. One BSF can produce enough clean water to meet a family’s daily drinking water needs. \n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe Wood Mold has undergone testing in both laboratory and field conditions to ensure it produces quality BioSand Filters. It was successfully implemented in Bangladesh, Ecuador and Mali in 2014. In total, 13 Wood Molds were made in these countries, producing over 250 BioSand Filters. Some of the molds were made using zero electricity and only hand tools. \n\nThe Wood Mold Construction Manual and Appendix are available for download on the OHorizons website (www.ohorizons.org/resources).

The \"three sisters\" are corn, pole beans, and either pumpkins or squash. This trio is one of the easiest and most satisfying to grow.\n\nEach of the sisters contributes something to the planting. Together, the sisters provide a balanced diet from a single planting.  How it works:\n - The corn offers the beans needed support.\n - The beans pull nitrogen from the air and bring it to the soil for the benefit of all three.\n - As the beans grow through the tangle of squash vines and wind their way up the cornstalks into the sunlight, they hold the three crops close together.\n - The large leaves of the sprawling squash protect the threesome by creating living mulch that shades the soil, keeping it cool and moist and preventing weeds.\n - The prickly squash leaves also keep away vermin and pests. \n\nTips for growing the three sisters:\n - To employ the technique in a spring garden, prepare the soil by adding fish scraps or wood ash to increase fertility, if desired.\n - Make a mound of soil about a foot high and four feet wide.\n - When the danger of frost has passed, plant the corn in the mound. Sow six kernels of corn an inch deep and about ten inches apart in a circle of about two feet in diameter.\n - When the corn is about five inches tall, plant four bean seeds, evenly spaced, around each stalk. About a week later, plant six squash seeds, evenly spaced, around the perimeter of the mound.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nSince 1792, The Old Farmer's Almanac has spoken to all walks of life: tide tables for those who live near the ocean, sunrise and planting charts for those who live on the farm, recipes for those who live in the kitchen and forecasts for those who don't like the question of weather left up in the air.\n\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.almanac.com/)  \n[Product page](http://www.almanac.com/content/companion-planting-three-sisters)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: The Old Farmer's Almanac\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac  \nDublin, NH  \n03444  \nUnited States  \n603-563-8111  \n   \n\n\n"

Farmers can connect and deal with food markets to sell their surplus food as well as to each other. Subsistence farmers often cannot sell the food they produce which can cause deprivation in other essentials such as education and health care. \n2. Farmers receive education on farming methods so they can produce as much as possible and prevent crop loss.\n3. Farmers are sold and/or loaned seeds and fertilizer. Fertilizer helps rejuvenate fields that have lost quality from misuse.\n4. Farmers learn improved storage techniques for the resulting harvest. The ability to store food safely allows it to be sold later when prices are better.\n5. The organization offers insurance against crop failure to minimize its impact on the farmer.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nOne acre fund was founded in 2006 by Andrew Youn.

Globally, 2.5 billion people rely on solid fuels for their daily energy needs, resulting in more than 1.6 million deaths per year and making indoor air pollution a leading cause of mortality for children under 5 in developing regions of the world. \n\nCombining advanced technology with user-centered design, the SolSource represents an exciting new design solution for communities and individuals everywhere. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nBy directly involving local stakeholders in the design process, OED empowered Himalayan communities to define their own vision of an effective solution. Community members from a variety of backgrounds participated as members of the team, and physical immersion by the organization yielded valuable insight into local preferences, traditions and needs. OED's formalized impact assessments supplied communities with the options and ideas they needed to balance tradeoffs and make well-informed decisions, while the informal feedback generated by iterative testing solidified a qualitative voice in the SolSource's creation.\n\nThroughout the process, many villagers communicated that existing alternatives to solid fuels were inappropriate for their social, economic and environmental needs. Traditional solar stoves are frequently designed only for cooking - leaving villagers reliant on solid fuels for heating - and are constructed with fragile concrete and glass components, yet rural communities lack the resources needed to repair broken devices. Moreover, many stoves weigh up to 95kg each. This excess weight hinders portability and in many cases prevents distribution networks from reaching the end-user. The SolSource's innovative design makes no sacrifice in efficiency for versatility and simplicity.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide   \nPrice range (USD): over 200 USD  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nWeight: 6 kg  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.oneearthdesigns.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.oneearthdesigns.com/products/solsource-s1/)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.oneearthdesigns.org/media/SolSource-Brochure-20100923.pdf)  \n[solsource-brochure-20100923.pdf](/ast/195-solsource-brochure-20100923.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: One Earth Designs\n\nScot Frank  \nOne Earth Designs  \nSheung Wan  \nHong Kong  \n852-8191-2525  \n[info@OneEarthDesigns.org](mailto:info@OneEarthDesigns.org)  \n\n\n"

It can boil about 1.5 liters of water in less than eight minutes.  It is like cooking on a stove powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), except that the fuel comes free: It uses rice husks, a farm waste common in agricultural countries like the Philippines. Unlike earlier devices this stove converts the husks into gas to emit a cleaner flame which helps the environment. “It will help minimize the problem of rice husk disposal which contributes a lot to environmental pollution,\" says the inventor.\n\nThe stove has the following advantages as compared to other commercially available stoves:\n\n1. It uses no cost rice husk fuel, which means cost savings to users\n\n2. It is convenient to operate since the start-up of fuel can be done by using pieces of paper, and gas is ignited using a match stick\n\n3. Almost no smoke can be observed during cooking. 4. It can cook rice and two viands per cooking, which is\ngood enough for a family of 4 to 6 members\n\n5. The degree of burning the fuel can be controlled using a rotary switch. Hence, the amount of flame on the burner can be regulated\n\n6. Gasified rice husks can be converted into char which is a good material as soil conditioner due to its high water holding capacity, or ash, when the burning of char is prolonged inside the reactor, which is a good refractory material\n\n7. It is also adoptable for battery, in case of brown out, by using an appropriate-sized inverter\n\n8. It is safe to operate with no danger of explosion since the stove operates at a normal atmospheric pressure.\n\nSome of the limitations of the stove are:\n\n1. It is difficult to use in areas where rice husks are not available. It cannot be used for other biomass material since the design was made for rice husks.\n\n2. It needs hauling of fuel when the source of rice husks is from a distance. In cities or urban areas, there is a need for a separate enterprise to ensure the supply of this fuel.\n\n3. Loading of fuel and unloading of burned rice husks are quite inconvenient. This is most especially true to households that are used to operating LPG stoves.\n\n4. It needs electricity to run the fan which limits its adoption in areas that are far from grid, except when a 12-volt battery and an appropriate inverter are available.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe stove, now in its third generation, comes in multiple sizes.  Thousands of stoves are in use in, for example, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.  The small household unit can be manufactured locally.  It is also available finished from multiple sources.

SociaLite operates at minimal cost, requires minimal technical knowledge and minimal access to a support infrastructure. Operated as a lighting service, each installation carries spare lanterns and parts. Should a user’s lantern fail for any reason, the lantern is either repaired immediately or replaced with a loaner while the user’s own lantern is repaired. The SociaLite lighting system currently consists of a centralized charging station that can accommodate up to 14 lanterns per day and lanterns that will run for approximately 40 hours at full power and well in excess of 200 hours on the low power setting. The complete lantern kit consists of: a circuit board, LED, 6V battery, 3 bicycle spokes, empty tub of hair relaxer, and empty container of cooking oil.\n \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe Socialite project is pursued by a group of students, alumni and faculty from the Engineering School of The Cooper Union in New York City, Wa Polytechnic (Ghana) and the National University of Rwanda.\n\nThe challenge of designing a lighting system for the world's poorest people was presented to a first-year engineering design class of 26 students in the fall 2006 semester. The project was initially realized with seed funding from the EPA and the NSF. Two grants from the NCIIA brought SociaLite to where it is today.\n\nIn February 2009, the project team partnered with faculty and students from Wa Polytechnic to assemble, install and maintain four systems in the Upper West Region of Ghana.\n\nThe cost of the components for the 80-lantern system that includes the charging station is 2400 USD, or 30 USD/lantern.\n\nPlease contact the solution owner for more details.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Ghana  \nPrice range (USD): 20 to 50 USD  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Ghana  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Product page](http://www.socialitelantern.com/About.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\n\n\nToby Cumberbatch  \nNew York  \nUSA  \n+1 212 353 4332  \n[socialite@cooper.edu](mailto:socialite@cooper.edu)  \n\n\n"

PUR contains a chlorine disinfectant (calcium hypochlorite) for killing bacteria and an iron salt coagulant (ferric sulfate) for removing suspended matter, protozoa, and viruses. It also contains a buffer, clay and polymer to provide good coagulation and flocculation. PUR is safe for long-term use by the entire family, including infants, and is considered an effective technology by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nPUR requires only a few simple tools that most target beneficiaries of disaster assistance should have at their disposal:\n\n    * a scissor or knife to open the sachet,\n    * a spoon or other implement to stir the water,\n    * a cloth fabric to filter the treated water, and\n    * two vessels (i.e. buckets) with volume capacity of 10 liters or more – the first to be used for the treatment process and the second to be used for storing the treated water.\n\nPUR comes in a 4 gram sachet labeled in English. Each sachet treats 10 litres of water. The sachets arrive from the manufacturing facility in cartons containing 20 strips of 12 sachets each, for a total of 240 sachets per carton. Each carton is 25 cm x 11 cm x 15.5 cm (length, width, height).\n\nStocks\nButyl Products holds up to 2,000,000 sachets of 'PUR' for immediate dispatch worldwide. They are the sole European agent for Procter & Gamble 'PUR'.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nPUR’s application results in water quality that meets WHO guidelines. In field and laboratory studies, PUR has been proven to eliminate disease-causing microorganisms and to remove virtually all suspended material. PUR results in removal of more than 99.99999% of bacteria (including those that cause cholera and typhoid fever), 99.99% of intestinal viruses (including those that cause hepatitis A), and 99.9% of protozoa (including Giardia and Cryptosporidum). In randomized controlled health intervention studies, PUR has been proven to reduce diarrheal disease incidence by up to 90%, with an average of about 50%. CARE, CDC, AmeriCares, Johns Hopkins University, and the Aquaya Institute have independently monitored PUR in a variety of emergency situations, including floods, refugee camps, and nutrition feeding programs, and concluded that PUR is both practical to use and results in a reduction in diarrheal illness. More than 200 million liters of safe drinking water have been provided by global relief groups using PUR. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice (USD): 15.84  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Worldwide  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions:  Each carton is 25 cm x 11 cm x 15.5 cm  \nWeight: 4g per sachet  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.csdw.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.csdw.org/csdw/pur-packet-technology.shtml)  \n[purinstructions.jpg](/ast/45-purinstructions.jpg)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: P&G Children’s Safe Drinking Water\n\nP&G Children’s Safe Drinking Water  \nCincinnati, Ohio  \n45202  \nUnited States  \n[jenny@butylproducts.co.uk](mailto:jenny@butylproducts.co.uk)  \n\n\n"

Babies who don’t weigh enough at birth are terribly vulnerable. Their bodies are not strong, and they may have a difficult time breathing, eating, gaining weight, and fighting infection. Babies who weigh less than 2.5 kg at birth are approximately 20 times more likely to die than heavier infants.\n\nMany babies in the developing world are delivered at home, by traditional birth attendants or midwives who may lack the training and tools to recognize low birth weight. PATH’s BIRTHweigh scale helps low-literate health workers identify low-birthweight children immediately. Once identified, these infants can be given care, such as immediate breastfeeding and warming, or referred for higher levels of medical care. The BIRTHweigh scale compensates for low levels of literacy by supplying pictorial instructions for use. It depends on a simple indicator for low birth weight and is easy to use; little training is required, allowing health workers in the developing world to detect low birth weight in infants before complications arise.\n\nTo use the BIRTHweigh scale, health workers place the baby in a secure sling that is suspended by a hook on the scale. Instead of the common digital or dial readouts that report an infant’s exact weight, the first version of the scale had a window that shows yellow if the baby’s weight is too low and blue if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kg, the desired weight for a healthy newborn.\n\nDuring tests in Indonesia—where 250,000 Indonesian infants die each year from preventable illnesses—we found that during night deliveries, in huts with little or no lighting, birth attendants were unable see the color change. PATH took the recommendations of the midwives and field testers and modified the scale to include a tactile indicator on the top of the handle. The indicator button sinks into the grip if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kilograms, and birth attendants can feel whether babies are at a healthy weight, even in the dark.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nMost recently, in response to new technologies that may allow newborns to be treated successfully in the home, PATH designed a new version of the scale, one that can identify three different weight categories. Each of these weight categories corresponds to a different dose of gentamicin, a drug used to treat severe bacterial infections. This version of the scale gives health workers a reliable tool for gauging how much medication to give a sick child. It empowers more workers to administer the drug and reduces the risk that the wrong dose will be given.\n\nPrototypes of PATH’s latest version of the BIRTHweigh scale, which is in a stage of active development, were successfully field-tested for accuracy and acceptability in Nepal and India in 2004. The scale is designed for local production and distribution, to reduce costs and stimulate economic development in the countries where the scale is used. One of the earlier versions of the scale is already in use in many countries and for sale through UNICEF under the name “BebeWey.” We are currently seeking a manufacturer to whom we can transfer the technology for the latest version, so that it will be readily available to community health workers who care for infants suffering from severe infection.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.path.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.path.org/publications/detail.php?i=1016)  \n[ts-update-bw3.pdf](/ast/139-ts-update-bw3.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: PATH\n\nPatricia Coffey  \nPATH  \nSeattle, WA  \n98109  \nUSA  \n2062853500  \n[pcoffey@path.org](mailto:pcoffey@path.org)  \n\n\n"

With the approval of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Nepal, that kit is now being sold and used throughout the country. More than one million kits have been sold since 1994. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations have demonstrated its acceptability and the effectiveness.\n\nTo further demonstrate the health the effects of kit use, PATH conducted the first cross-sectional study of single-use delivery kits in Africa. This major quantitative evaluation of the kit’s impact on preventing cord infection and puerperal sepsis in Tanzania was carried out in collaboration with the National Institute for Medical Research and the MOH. A total of 3,262 women were enrolled in the study, which was completed in late 2004. Results show that the kit has significant impact in reducing rates of infection. Newborns of mothers who used the clean delivery kit were about 13 times less likely to develop cord infection than infants whose mothers did not use the kit. Women who used the kit were about 3 times less likely to develop puerperal sepsis than women who did not use the kit. The study results suggest that making clean delivery kits available through government health clinics, markets, private pharmacies, or other commercial channels could likely help reduce rates of infection. PATH continues to seek opportunities to promote the use of clean delivery kits and integrate their use into larger maternal and child health programming around the world.

For rabies vaccine, the same or better protection can be achieved by delivering smaller amounts of vaccine intradermally (into the top layer of the skin), sparing valuable doses and stretching supplies to provide for more patients. Intradermal (ID) regimens for rabies vaccine have been adopted in many regions, protecting people who have been exposed to rabid animals, while saving costs and vaccine.\n\nThis approach is not yet universal, despite clear benefits, due in part to the difficulty of giving an ID injection correctly. The Mantoux technique, which uses a traditional needle and syringe for ID delivery, has historically been recognized as a difficult and inconsistently used technique. In many countries, only certain health care workers are able to perform ID injections, such as for rabies vaccine and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin or BCG, a vaccine given intradermally at birth to prevent tuberculosis. Smaller ID doses of other vaccines could also be effective. Such dose sparing could be particularly meaningful to immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries, as they could potentially reduce the amount of vaccine needed per patient, thereby cutting costs and overcoming vaccine shortages. However, concerns regarding the difficulty and a lack of reliability of conventional ID injections limit research in this field and introduction of this technique into immunization programs. \n\nThe intradermal adapter makes ID injections easier. It facilitates the procedure by standardizing injection depth and angle. It is anticipated that the ID adapter would expand the pool of health care workers capable of performing the procedure. This would have a particularly high impact in remote or underserved communities with more limited access to health care specialists.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIn partnership with SID Technologies of Newtown, Pennsylvania, PATH developed the ID adapter from the initial concept through manufacturing of clinic-ready devices. We modified and tested successive design prototypes, incorporating feedback from health care workers in the United States and India. Performance of the current model has been proven in preclinical testing, and will be demonstrated in a clinical trial with saline and ultrasound imaging in the United States in 2011. The ID adapter will then be used in a clinical trial with rabies vaccine in 2011.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: contact supplier  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.westpharma.com)  \n[Product page](http://www.westpharma.com/en/products/Pages/ID-Adapter.aspx)  \n[ts-update-id-adapt.pdf](/ast/140-ts-update-id-adapt.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: PATH\n\nPATH  \nSeattle, WA  \n98109  \nUSA  \n206.285.3500  \n[info@path.org](mailto:info@path.org)  \n\n\n"

It may sound too good to be true, but PATH and our commercial partners are bringing “jet injection” to developing-country immunization programs, where the technology will make it safer for kids to get their shots.\n\nJet injectors use pressure rather than needles to deliver vaccine as a fine stream of fluid that passes through the skin and into the tissue. New and improved over older models that had some drawbacks, today’s jet injectors overcome many of the risks associated with injections in low-resource settings.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nJet injectors hit the immunization scene in the 1960s and were used to give millions of injections over about a 20-year period; they helped eradicate smallpox. Unfortunately, they fell out of favor with public health officials in the 1980s, after they were suspected of spreading hepatitis. The need for a needle-free technology remained.\n\nThe problem was that older injectors administered multiple doses of vaccine from a single vial. New injectors use disposable syringes—each containing a single dose of vaccine—that prevent the transmission of infection from one person to the next.\n\nPATH has worked with several jet injector companies over the years to advance “second-generation” jet injectors. Designed for use in developing-country clinics or large immunization campaigns, these jet injectors are hand-wound or spring-powered, generating a high pressure stream so that the vaccine penetrates the skin.

Birth asphyxia/trauma—the condition when a baby does not breathe at birth—is the third most common cause of newborn deaths, accounting for 23 percent of all fatalities. Limited data suggest that deaths due to birth asphyxia have remained relatively unchanged in developing countries. The key to reducing these deaths is the provision of appropriate care to underserved populations during delivery. Approximately 50 million women give birth without a skilled attendant, 99 percent of whom live in low-income countries. Appropriate care for birth asphyxia requires that neonatal resuscitation skills and appropriate technology should be available to all skilled birth attendants and to community-level workers where skilled attendants are not available.\n\nEffective neonatal resuscitation equipment is needed by all birth attendants in order to reduce the danger of birth asphyxiation. Neonatal resuscitator technologies that are affordable and easy to use, clean, and store could increase the use of such lifesaving devices in the developing world. While currently available neonatal resuscitation devices are available in both bag and mask designs and tube and mask designs, their accessibility is limited in some world regions due to poor availability and affordability. The estimated potential impact of widespread introduction and use of neonatal resuscitators could be about one million neonatal deaths averted annually.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nPATH’s focus is to enhance availability of appropriate devices in low-resource settings, particularly Asia and Africa. PATH conducted a web-based survey of neonatal experts to determine practices and preferences related to neonatal resuscitators in developing countries. PATH also published an inventory of all neonatal resuscitation devices currently available worldwide. PATH then conducted an assessment of the performance and functionality, safety during use and reuse, ease of assembly and disassembly, and device construction of many devices. Particular attention was given to those that are reusable, silicone bag and mask devices that cost less than US$30 each. The results are published in the “Practical selection of neonatal resuscitators: a field guide.” All three documents are available on PATH’s website. In addition, PATH conducted a situation analysis of essential newborn care and services in selected states in India. Results are available upon request. \n\nTo understand potential demand and supply and distribution channels of neonatal resuscitation devices, PATH conducted market research in southern African countries and is currently developing advocacy materials to raise awareness about lower-cost, high-quality devices that are available in the region. Further, in early 2009 PATH initiated market research in West African countries of not only resuscitators but also neonatal resuscitation mannequins and suction devices.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Product page](http://www.path.org/projects/neonatal_resuscitators.php)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.path.org/publications/detail.php?i=1775)  \n[ts-update-neonatal-resusc.pdf](/ast/147-ts-update-neonatal-resusc.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: PATH\n\nPATH  \nSeattle, WA  \n98109  \nUSA  \n(206) 285-3500  \n[info@path.org](mailto:info@path.org)  \n\n\n"

Each year, nearly 80 million women experience unintended pregnancies, about half of these end in abortion. Hundreds of millions of women annually suffer disability from pregnancy complications, and more than 500,000 die as a result of pregnancy, childbirth, or unsafe abortion. Almost all these deaths are preventable. Women also represent more than 50 percent of people living with AIDS; and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), excluding HIV/AIDS, are the second most important cause of loss of health in women, especially young women. Women want and need more female-initiated methods that can protect against pregnancy and STIs. Diaphragms could help meet this need, but some characteristics of traditional diaphragms limit their use and acceptability.\n\nPATH responded to the call for simple-to-use, female barrier protection by developing the SILCS Diaphragm, a single-size, reusable device with a contoured rim that allows the SILCS Diaphragm to fit most women with improved comfort. Design and development of the SILCS Diaphragm began in 1994, and user-centered evaluations of over 200 prototype designs refined performance and features. The single-size design will simplify the logistics of supply and provision. PATH used stakeholder assessments to ensure that comfort, ease of handling, and acceptability were built into the product. As a result, the SILCS Diaphragm directly addresses user and programmatic needs which will lead to improved access and acceptability. Acceptability studies among naïve users in South Africa and  Thailand found that women were able to learn to use the device easily and that women and men found the SILCS Diaphragm acceptable during use. In a comparative crossover study of the SILCS Diaphragm with a traditional diaphragm in the Dominican Republic, 19 of 20 women reported preferring the SILCS Diaphragm device after short-term use. Eventually, the single-size device could be provided over the counter or outside the clinic-based system where regulatory authority and clinical practice allow.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe SILCS Diaphragm design was patented by PATH in 1998; a second patent on a spring modi cation has been  led. Clinical validation is nearly complete. An application to the United States Food and Drug Administration as a contraceptive is expected in 2011. PATH also is evaluating the SILCS Diaphragm as a microbicide delivery system. PATH is actively seeking regional partners to manufacture, distribute, and introduce this new diaphragm through both private- and public-sector markets in selected countries.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Product page](http://www.path.org/projects/silcs.php)  \n[ts-update-silcs.pdf](/ast/148-ts-update-silcs.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: PATH\n\nPATH  \nSeattle, WA  \n98109  \nUSA  \n(206) 285-3500  \n[info@path.org](mailto:info@path.org)  \n\n\n"

Each year, more than 12 billion injections are administered worldwide; in developing countries 50 percent of injections are estimated to be unsafe. A primary source of transmission of disease has been the reuse of contaminated needles and syringes. To be completely safe, single-use injection devices must be designed to automatically and irrevocably inactivate a\bfter a single cycle of filling and injection. The World Health Organization/Expanded Programme on Immunization (WHO/EPI) called for the design of such devices in 1987.\n\nIn response to WHO’s call, PATH designed one of the first feasible approaches to nonreusable syringes for immunizations: an autodisable (AD) syringe with a fixed needle that automatically locks a\bfter a single injection. When the syringe is filled to the preset 0.5-ml level, the plunger stops and cannot be pulled back further. A\bfter the vaccine is injected, the plunger automatically locks so that the syringe and needle cannot be reused. Known as the SoloShot syringe, this technology was licensed to and is now manufactured and marketed by BD, one of the world’s leading syringe manufacturers. Third-party field validations of the device in Pakistan in the early 1990s demonstrated the acceptability and usability of the design. PATH also has assisted several other manufacturers of AD syringes to ensure a wide variety of products are available and to facilitate the lower pricing that accompanies increased competition and production volume.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nSince commercial introduction in 1992, 5.4 billion immunizations have been delivered using SoloShot syringes by public health programs in more than 40 countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. United Nations Children’s Fund—which has already distributed hundreds of millions of AD syringes to EPI programs—now provides only AD syringes to countries requesting disposable syringes, many of which are SoloShot syringes. BD has renewed its five-year licensing agreement from PATH, which allows it to supply SoloShot syringes to national and international public health agencies at low cost. The price of AD syringes is dropping rapidly and is currently within two cents of the price of disposable syringes. PATH is also assisting USAID-supported family planning agencies with the introduction of a 1-ml AD syringe to be bundled with injectable contraceptives.\n\nAD syringes are now routinely used in immunization programs throughout the world. They can be used safely by vaccinators regardless of past experience or training. The devices are quicker to use than a conventional syringe and are preferred over a conventional syringe by vaccinators due to the speed and ease with which a correct vaccine dose can be drawn.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 3/8” (10 mm) to 1½” (38 mm) needle length  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.bd.com/pharmaceuticals/)  \n[Product page](http://www.bd.com/pharmaceuticals/products/auto-disable.asp)  \n[ts-update-soloshot.pdf](/ast/141-ts-update-soloshot.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: PATH\n\nPATH  \nSeattle, WA  \n98109  \nUSA  \n2062853500  \n[info@path.org](mailto:info@path.org)  \n\n\n"

When the Ultra Rice grains are blended with white rice—usually in a ratio of about 1 to 100—the result is nearly identical to unfortified rice in smell, taste, and texture.\n\nThe technology is ingenious in its ability to protect micronutrients within the manufactured grain. In addition to preventing them from being rinsed away, the Ultra Rice grains preserve sensitive micronutrients from degradation during storage. Currently, there are two formulations of Ultra Rice. One carries vitamin A, and the other can carry iron, thiamin, folic acid, and zinc.\n\nThe Ultra Rice technology can be adapted to contain just the nutrients a population needs—and to mimic the look of the local rice. Its versatility allows grains that look like the short-grained rice of China to carry one combination of vitamins and minerals, while grains resembling the longer, thinner rice in Brazil deliver a completely different combination of micronutrients.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nMicronutrient deficiencies threaten the health, development, and productivity of millions of people worldwide. According to UNICEF and the Micronutrient Initiative, each year:\n\nSevere iron deficiency anemia results in the death of more than 60,000 young women during pregnancy and childbirth. In the developing world, iron deficiency in 6- to 24-month-olds may impair the mental development of the 40 to 60 percent of children who suffer from it. \n\nVitamin A deficiency compromises the immune systems of approximately 40 percent of children under five and causes about 1,000,000 deaths in the developing world. \n\nFolic acid deficiency is responsible for approximately 200,000 severe birth defects in 80 developing countries. \n\nMild to moderate zinc deficiency affects more than a third of people worldwide and compromises growth and immune function in children.\n\n\nOne approach to alleviating malnutrition is fortifying staple foods with micronutrients. On a large scale, food fortification can be cost-effective and sustainable, and it allows people to get more nutritional value from the food they already eat. \n\nTo bring fortification to vulnerable rice-consuming communities, PATH developed a manufactured “grain” that can be mixed with rice to provide nutrients the local diet may lack. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Brazil, Columbia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Mali, India, Philippines  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://path.org/index.php)  \n[Product page](http://path.org/projects/ultra_rice.php)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: PATH\n\nPATH  \nSeattle, WA  \n98121  \nUSA  \n206-285-6619  \n[info@path.org](mailto:info@path.org)  \n\n\n"

When filling jerry cans, over one million litres of water can be wasted each year.  Popular hand pumps waste more than 30% of the water pumped due to the chaotic flow as the water exits the spout of the hand pump.  Permafunnel is inserted into the spout and provides an internal, unseen funnel that effectively calms the water flow.  Water waste is reduced to virtually nil; contamination is reduced due the now unnecessary improvised funnel; maintenance is reduced due to the reduced amount of pumping required to fill peoples jerry cans.  Every India Mark hand pump should be fitted with the Permafunnel to better serve those who work so hard for their daily water requirements.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe Permafunnel was invented in 2008 in West Darfur, Sudan by Rowan Matthews-Frederick whilst managing a large water program.

Clean hands. Wash hands with clean water and soap, once before delivery and once before cord cutting.\n2. Clean delivery surface. A plastic sheet for mothers to lie upon during delivery maintains a clean birth canal and perineum, and protects the newborn from potential sources of infection.\n3. Clean cord cut. A new razor blade in its original packing is sterile and can prevent the transmission of tetanus-causing spores and other pathogenic organisms via the umbilicus to the infant.\n4. Clean cord ties. Additionally, the use of clean thread or narrow tape to tightly tie the umbilicus helps keep the stump healthy.\n5. Clean cord stump care. Applying antiseptic such as chlorhexidine to the cord stump to prevent infection is the best care.\n\nWhere permitted by local regulations, PSI clean delivery kits may also include:\n\n- The antiseptic chlorhexidine for newborn skin washing and umbilical cord cleaning. Chlorhexidine has been shown to reduce newborn deaths by as much as 23 percent when applied within the first 24 hours of birth.\n- Misoprostol pills. A uterotonic drug which contracts the uterus, these pills can help to prevent excessive bleeding. Excessive bleeding after delivery, called postpartum hemorrhage, is the single biggest direct cause of maternal deaths – more than 220 women die of it every day. \n\nMisoprostol taken immediately after delivery significantly decreases a woman’s risk of postpartum hemorrhage and does not require refrigeration or injection, making it possible for a woman to take it after a home delivery without a trained attendant.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nPSI is a global health organization dedicated to improving the health of people in the developing world by focusing on serious challenges: a lack of family planning, HIV and AIDS, barriers to maternal health, and the greatest threats to children under five, including malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition. \n\nA hallmark of PSI is a commitment to the principle that health services and products are most effective when they are accompanied by robust communications and distribution efforts that help ensure wide acceptance and proper use. \n\nPSI works in partnership with local governments, ministries of health and local organizations to create health solutions that are built to last. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.psi.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.psi.org/program/clean-delivery-kits/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Population Services International (PSI)\n\nPopulation Services International (PSI)  \nWashington, DC  \n20036  \nUnited States  \n+1 (202) 785-0072  \n[info@psi.org](mailto:info@psi.org)  \n\n\n"

Many now reside in large displacement camps where they receive food aid but still must gather firewood to cook their meals. In response, women must either walk up to seven hours to find a single tree, risking assault every step of the way…or purchase wood from vendors, by selling the very food they need to feed their families.  In response to this crisis, Potential Energy has developed and distributed more than 27,000 fuel-efficient wood-burning cookstoves to women in Darfur – easing their financial burden, diminishing their families’ exposure to smoke, reducing the carbon impact on the planet, and reducing their exposure to violence while collecting wood. The stoves were designed in collaboration with displaced women in Darfur, which ensured that the stove met their needs and led to our high adoption rates of nearly 100%. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe Berkeley-Darfur Stove is designed through our partnership with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. We continue to iterate the stove in response to feedback from Darfuri women. We work with Oxfam America (an international relief and development organization) to secure Sudanese government permissions and negotiate tariffs, and Plan Canada/Plan Sudan (an international NGO) for local operational expertise. We contract with Shri Hari Industries, an Indian parts manufacturer, to manufacture stove flat-kits, which are then shipped to Port Sudan. This manufacturing approach keeps transportation costs low and quality high. Our local partner, Sustainable Action Group (SAG, a registered Sudanese charity) collects the flat kits and brings them overland to El Fasher, Darfur, where they manage stove assembly, distribution, training and evaluation. Local assembly creates business opportunities for SAG, economic opportunities for local Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and Women’s Development Associations (WDAs), and employment opportunities for local displaced people.\n\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Sudan (soon Ethiopia)  \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Must contact Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Sudan  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nWeight: 5.5 kg  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Product page](http://www.potentialenergy.org)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/04/201342412829127536.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Potential Energy\n\nDebra Stein  \nPotential Energy  \nBerkeley, CA  \n94704  \nUSA  \n5108488486  \n[debra@potentialenergy.org](mailto:debra@potentialenergy.org)  \n\n\n"

The simplest press utilizes a hand-operated hydraulic truck jack and two-piece aluminum mold.\n\nAfter firing to about 860°c. the filter is coated with colloidal silver. The combination of fine pore size, resulting from milled, screened materials, and the bactericidal properties of colloidal silver produce an effective filter.\n\nA 1.5 to 2.5 liter per hour rate of filtration is determined by the combination of clay/combustible mix and firing temperature.\n\nFor use the fired, treated filter element is placed in a five gallon plastic or ceramic receptacle with a lid and faucet. Pricing for ready to use filter units is determined by local production costs and is usually between $15-25 with the basic plastic receptacle.\n\nReplacement filter elements will cost $4 to $6. A basic production facility with three or four workers can produce about fifty filters a day.\n\nPotters for Peace does not operate filter making facilities or sell filters but trains others to do so. Potters for Peace recieves no financial benefit in the form of a percentage of filter sales or in any other manner from the filter producers, the workshops are independent businesses owned by organizations or individuals. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nPotters for Peace is a member of the World Health Organization’s International Network to Promote Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage. \n\nSince 1998, Potters for Peace has been assisting in the production worldwide of a low-tech, low-cost, colloidal silver-enhanced ceramic water purifier (CWP). Field experience and clinical test results have shown this filter to effectively eliminate approximately 99.88% of most water born disease agents.\n\nThe filter design used by PFP was developed by Dr. Fernando Mazariegos of the Central American Industrial Research Institute (ICAITI) in Guatemala, in 1981. The goal was to make bacterially contaminated water safe for the poorest of the poor by developing a low cost filter which could be fabricated at the community level. \n\nIn 1994 AFA or Family Foundation of the Americas, a Guatemalan organization, became interested in the ceramic water filter when it was found that other strategies were not yielding effective results. Chlorine tablets in rural communities were not well accepted; health complications associated with chlorine misuse caused additional concern. Boiled water often wasn’t effective when households failed to boil water long enough to purify it. AFA carried out a one year follow-up study on the initial Mazariegos-led filter project, concluding that including this filter into rural health education efforts reduced the incidence of diarrhea in participating households by as much as 50 percent.\n\nIn October 1998, Hurricane Mitch tore through Central America. It was one of the most destructive hurricanes ever recorded, affecting millions of people. Safe water was urgently needed as supply systems (already of borderline capacity and efficiency) had been badly damaged. This prompted Potters for Peace to begin a Ceramic Water Filter production workshop in Nicaragua using the Mazariegos design.\nIn the first six months over 5000 filters were distributed through non-governmental organizations. The workshop, called Filtron, evolved into a worker-owned cooperative and is now incorporated as a privately owned business.\n\nPotters for Peace has since provided consultation and training to set up production facilities around the world: Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Ghana, El Salvador, the Darfur region of Sudan, Kenya, Benin, Yemen, Nigeria, Tanzania, Peru, Somaliland and others.\n\nThe CWP has been cited by the United Nations’ Appropriate Technology Handbook, and tens of thousands of filters have been distributed worldwide by organizations such as International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF, Plan International, Project Concern International, Oxfam and USAID.\n\nWe have financed or assisted in laboratory testing and field studies of the filter with various institutions, among them: MIT, Tulane University, University of Colorado and University of North Carolina. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice (USD): 15-25  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 11\" wide x 10\" deep  \nWeight: 15kg  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.pottersforpeace.org/ )  \n[Product page](http://pfp.he207.vps.webenabled.net/?page_id=63)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Potters for Peace\n\nKaira  Wagoner  \nPotters for Peace  \nGreensboro, NC  \n27407  \nUSA  \n520-249-8093  \n[pottersforpeace@gmail.com](mailto:pottersforpeace@gmail.com)  \n\n\n"

The pump-set can be used on shallow wells or tube wells, on rivers and widely on a water surface. \n\nSmall scale irrigation, using small pump sets is becoming increasingly popular in West Africa. The biggest obstacle for farmers is the high cost of the pump-set (€ 300-600). The Practica Foundation has identified a pump-set in China costing not more than about €140 (resale price for farmers). \n\nApart from having a low investment cost, the fuel consumption is also about 40% less than that of the presently available pump sets. \n\nProduct specifications: 1.5hp; fuel consumption:0,5 litres/hour; suction head depth: 7 meters depth; maximum total head:30 meters; maximum discharge:25 cubic meters/hour, weight:15 kilos. Experience in Nicaragua has shown that a lifetime in excess of 2000 hours is possible.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe pump is imported from China at low cost. Practica Foundation takes responsilbilty for the quality monitoring of the product. \n\nIn certain cases it is possible to modify the motor to run on kerosene fuel as well instead of petrol. In most countries kerosene is widely available and cheaper than petrol. Tests in Madagascar has shown a reduction of the cost running of 25% with kerosene and a reduction of 60% of the cost running in comparison with petrol pump-set available on the local market. \n\nPRACTICA can facilitate procurement of these pumps and spare parts from China, the establishment of a dealer network, training of mechanics and general promotion.

These wells can be adapted to a variety of settings, such as flooded areas or lands with unfavorable soil conditions.\n\nPRACTICA has ample experience in selecting suitable, low-cost pumps that are design for pulling water from shallow wells in a variety of farming contexts.  Common pumps for smallholder irrigation not only include human-powered rope pumps and treadle pumps, but also different engine pumps and low-cost micro pump sets. \n\nEfficient distribution systems can be a major improvement in water-scarce areas, since conventional furrow irrigation results in high water losses. Drip irrigation and Californian irrigation are two examples of alternatives that PRACTICA focuses on. \n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nEfficient use of irrigation can increase the income of smallholder farmers drastically.

They are used for fuel in households for cooking, water heating, and space heating. In Kenya, people use firewood and charcoal for cooking. The prices of firewood and charcoal have been increasing drastically, making it less affordable for most users. Briquettes are a proven technology that provides a low-cost fuel for households that is locally made and can be used as an alternative to wood or charcoal. Fuel briquettes can also be used in institutions for large scale cooking, and in industries for production use.\n\nThere are two types of eco-fuel briquettes:\n1. Non-carbonized fuel briquettes: these are produced from waste materials that are not carbonized such as saw dust, and waste paper.\n2. Carbonized fuel briquettes: these are made from waste materials that have undergone carbonization such as charcoal dust, or carbonizing non-carbonized briquettes.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nPractical Action is an international development organization working with communities to find practical solutions to the poverty they face.

The spatial grid is intended to combine active movement and competition with mathematic curricula, providing an outdoor classroom framework for fun and engaged learning. Because math is universal, Learning Landscape can be adapted for use in any country and can be tailored to a range of skill levels.\n\nThe designers conceived of various math-based games to be played within a square grid, which can be built in a 4x4 or 5x5 configuration based on the number of students and space constraints.\n\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nFor the pilot installation at the Kutamba School for AIDS Orphans in Uganda, a 16-point grid was constructed using reclaimed tires arranged inside a large sand box. The tires mark points on the grid, and during game play, numbers can be written directly on them with chalk. (The tires can also be used as outdoor classroom space when coupled with an integrated bench system.)\n\nThe games, including Match Me, Math Musical Chairs, Math Around The World, and more, teach concepts including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as spatial and logical reasoning through individual and team-based competition. Because of the system’s flexibility, teachers and students are encouraged to invent their own games as well.\n\nSince the Kutamba installation, Project H has installed 4 Learning Landscapes for the Bertie County School District in North Carolina, and one at the Maria Auxiliadora Primary School in Mao, Dominican Republic. The Bertie District (North Carolina) teachers have adapted the system for geography, language arts, and science material, and have helped Project H expand the functionality of the Learning Landscape as a testing/assessment tool. With their feedback, the design team is developing a set of peripherals including small and large whiteboards for outdoor use. Learning Landscape, as an educational tool, is both universally adaptable and context specific, making it functional on a global scale and in variable implementations. Project H has continued its adaptation of the system, working with Palo Alto-based design firm nonobject to develop off-the-shelf retail and tabletop versions available to teachers.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Free  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Please contact Project H Design  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://projecthdesign.org/)  \n[Product page](http://www.projecthdesign.org/#learning-landscape)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Project H Design\n\nEmily Pilloton  \nProject H Design  \nWindsor, NC   \n27983  \nUSA  \n510-206-2396  \n[info@projecthdesign.org](mailto:info@projecthdesign.org)  \n\n\n"

The benefits include reductions in respiratory illness, forest degradation (14-29 trees per stove), and carbon emissions (~13 mtCO2); as well as poverty alleviation through reduced fuelwood consumption and the creation of 17 microenterprises and 130 jobs. Proyecto Mirador, a non-profit organization, sells Gold Standard carbon offsets to construct in-situ Dos por Tres plancha, chimney type stoves in poor, rural Honduras.  Mirador builds over 2,000 stoves a month and has two years of backlog in stove requests.  Families co-invest in stove construction with materials and time; no cash changes hands with our beneficiaries.  Mirador emphasizes training and maintenance to ensure stoves survive for 5 years or more.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nProyecto Mirador is a grassroots organization that grew organically after the founders were in Honduras as translators for medical clinics and saw a disproportionate number of cases of respiratory illness, particularly among women and children, in the clinic.  Their daughter, Skye, was invited into a home and experienced first hand the smoke filled rooms, causing her to recognize the source of so many illnesses.  Thus, Mirador was conceived and began to install the La Justa rocket stove, which was later adapted to improve efficiency and durability.  Mirador's proprietary adaptation of the original La Justa is called the Dos por Tres.  It is a plancha style stove, built in situ, that is functionally the same as the traditional, inefficient stove that is replaced and thus, easily assimilated and positively received by the beneficiary.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Honduras  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Honduras  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 1150/560/360 cm  \nWeight: 125.0 kg (built in situ)  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.proyectomirador.org/)  \n[Product page](https://products.markit.com/br-reg/public/master-project.jsp?project_id=103000000001450)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.proyectomirador.org/library/documents)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Proyecto Mirador\n\nProyecto Mirador  \nLarkspur  \n94904  \nUSA  \n415-464-9590  \n[info@proyectomirador.org](mailto:info@proyectomirador.org)  \n\n\n"

Boolify makes it easier for students to understand their web search by illustrating the logic of their search, and by showing them how each change to their search instantly changes their results.\n\nSearch results are presented through Google's \"Safe Search STRICT\" technology. There are two important caveats: a) no filtering technology is 100% secure and 2) we are unable to control or modify the results that we provide, beyond the filtering settings available through Google.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nDede (2000) astutely remarked that “children must learn how to sift vast quantities of information through their fingertips” and “thrive on chaos”. In our lifetimes, the quantity of information available for sifting-through has increased exponentially. Yet, the tools for “learning or teaching how to sift” have not maintained pace with the need for sifting.\n\nWith this challenge in mind, the Boolify Project offers a piece of software that helps model Boolean operators. Its primary audience is Elementary and Middle School children, but it may find relevance with others. Ultimately, its goal is to increase a learners’ ability to perform effective web searches. Just how will it accomplish this?\n\nIt is hypothesized that the visual cues Boolify provides will help learners build a mental model of the search that they are performing. A mental model is an internal visualization that can be used to guide practice and, in the case of Boolify, the software helps make explicit and graphical the formation and the results of their search.\n\nThe mental model is visualized as puzzle pieces that fit together, demonstrating how search terms and operators are linked, and a table that provides real-time feedback to the learner about the efficacy of the search. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nLocal Price: Free  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Product page](http://www.boolify.org)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: The Public Learning Media Laboratory, Inc.\n\nThe Public Learning Media Laboratory, Inc.  \nCambridge  \nMA  \n(617) 575-9124  \n[info@plml.org](mailto:info@plml.org)  \n\n\n"

The Elephant Toilet has won the prestigious St. Andrews Prize for Environment 2008 for best design.\n\nA pit 3 metres deep is dug out and lined with stones. A concrete slab is laid over the pit. This is the most expensive part of the construction.\n\nThe slab has two 'elephant ears' to stand on, a hole opening over the pit for solid matter to drop into, and an elephant's trunk that channels away urine into a compost pit. By keeping urine out of the pit, the faeces will decompose more easily as urine kills its useful bacteria.\n\nWalls are built around the pit with an internal chimney running up the side. The construction uses sundried bricks rather than wood burnt to prevent deforestation.\n\nA thatched roof covers the toilet to complete a fully private enclosure.\n\nThe light entering through the bottle attracts flies, which are then eliminated by the heat inside.\n\nFor soap, a seso bush that has antiseptic qualities, is planted outside the toilet. It is watered by the stream of waste water from hand washing.\n\nWhen the pit is full (and it will take several years) the concrete slab is moved to a new pit and a fruit tree is planted in the old one. The fruit it produces will supplement the diet of the local community or can be taken to market to bring much-needed income for the community.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: rural Africa  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.pumpaid.org)  \n[Product page](http://pumpaid.org/how/elephanttoilet/)  \n[how-to-build-an-elephant-toilet.doc](/ast/194-how-to-build-an-elephant-toilet.doc)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Pump Aid\n\nAlexa  Doman  \nPump Aid  \nLondon  \nUK  \n0207 922 7992  \n[fundraising@pumpaid.org](mailto:fundraising@pumpaid.org)  \n\n\n"

Its uniqueness lies in the design of the longitudinal shaft or central hole, through which a rope is tied, to pull or roll the drum along all terrain types. Due to the low-density polyethylene it is made from, it is also practically indestructible and has no removable handles or other metal attachments that could detract from its intended purpose if lost or broken. \n\nThe rope can be repaired on the spot or easily replaced by a leather thong, woven plant substance or any other appropriate material. In many rural areas around the world, even a hammer and nail are scarce commodities.\n\nAnother important characteristic of the Q Drum is that the longitudinal shaft also serves as a vertical support structure which provides added strength and increases the top load compression resistance when filled containers are stacked on top of each other.\n\nMost existing containers can only be stacked two or maybe three high when filled with heavy fluids or other substances as in the chemical and agriculture industries. In a SABS (South African Bureau of Standards) compression test performed on the Q Drum, the maximum load reached before collapse was 3,7 tons which equates to 40 full containers stacked approximately 25 metres high!\n\nThis exceeds the international stacking requirements a number of times, making Q Drum an easy vessel to store and transport in large quantities.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe idea of the Q Drum originated in response to the needs of rural people in developing countries who have a problem carrying adequate quantities of potable water from a reliable source.\n\nA burden which is generally bestowed on the women and children of each community.

The solar panels are installed on the QBotix designed trackers without individual motors and are optimized for cost, strength, durability and installation simplicity. The robots travel on a track and adjust each tracker periodically to optimally face the sun.  This design aims to optimize for material usage, reliability and ease of installation.\n\nEach robot replaces hundreds of individual motors and controllers found on conventional tracking systems. In addition, the back-up robot provides built in system redundancy. This improves the system reliability and ensures high availability of tracking capability.\n\nKey Features:\n- Costs as little as existing single axis systems but generates up to 15 percent more energy. QTS will generate up to 40 percent more energy than fixed mount systems.\n- Compatible with all standard solar modules, inverters and foundation types used in ground-mounted installations for commercial, distributed generation and utility deployments.\n- Ships pre-assembled and can be installed without using heavy equipment.

Locally harvested plant oils often cost less than half the cost of conventional diesel fuel, making plant oil adapters a cost effective and environmentally sustainable solution to off-grid energy needs.  \n\nWaste heat from the engine is used to reduce the viscosity of the bio-oil to a level that allows the injection spray to replicate that of diesel. Integrated heaters and valve arrangements manage the switching between the primary fuel and bio-oil, when pre-determined parameters are met (which can be adjusted to suit particular engine requirements). \n\nA separate fuel pump is provided to pump the bio-oil from the independent bulk storage through the system. The pump is driven by means of a separate electric motor. The pump may also be driven by an engine mounted PTO where a suitable PTO is available.\n\nThe pumps are sized to match the fuel consumption and to enable an additional volume to be pumped through the system, to allow multiple passes in order to gain as much heat transfer and oil filtration as possible.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nEarly generation RPS Technology was first deployed in the maritime environment in Papua New Guinea in 2006-2007 on a RORO Ferry where 10,000 shp engines ran on palm olein.

Using local materials and manufacturing methods RDI makes and distributes water filters throughout Cambodia. RDI also makes available in-depth technical information about how to construct and install a ceramic filtration system for approximately $10 US dollars using locally available materials.  This system is especially valuable in areas where electricity is not available or where minimal understanding of germs and water born illness is prevalent.\n\nProduct overview- Smooth, even-surfaced filter element- 0.2-micron pore size- 10L capacity- 1.5-2.2L/hour flow rate- Silver-nitrate painted (300mL total)- Food grade, pigment-less plastic container- Silver-impregnated ceramic tap \n\nHow does it work?\n1. A specially constructed clay/ceramic pot is placed inside the top of a large water storage container. \n\n2. Contaminated water is poured into the ceramic pot.  \n\n3. As the water seeps through the porous pot, nearly all of the impurities are removed. \n\n4. Pure drinkable water is collected in the large water container and immediately ready for consumption.\n\nThis product is very inexpensive and easy to use.  It removes all germs and bacteria from water, and works with both rainwater and surface water. The filter will purify 2 liters per hour.\nNB. This filter cannot remove arsenic, or other chemical contaminants from water.  As a result, this is not a good device for arsenic contaminated well water.  (Its best used in Cambodia for rain and surface water.) Not time efficient for purifying large quantities of water.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nRDIC has been making ceramic water filters in Cambodia since 2003. RDIC’s operation started at a small scale as it developed its manufacturing techniques.  By September 2007 RDIC had distributed approximately 60,000 filters throughout Cambodia, and internationally, with 24,000 produced in 2007.\n\nCeramic water filters have proven to be tremendously effective in reducing the exposure of users to contaminated water, and the incidence diarrhea over an extended period of time (Brown and Sobsey, 2006). \n\nField trials of the effectiveness of ceramic water filters in Cambodia over time showed a 46% reduction in diarrheal disease between filter users and non-users, a 95.1% average (and up to 99.99%) reduction of E.coli in drinking water (Brown and Sobsey, 2006).  \n\nLaboratory testing has shown a 90-99% reduction in viruses (Brown, 2007). These results support other trials of ceramic water filters (Lantagne, 2001) as a highly successful means of empowering households to manage their own safe water supply.\n\nRDIC continues to invest significant time and energy into developing its processes and would like to share its knowledge and best practice approaches with organisations who wish to have a similarly positive impact on communities in developing countries.\n\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Cambodia  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.rdic.org)  \n[Product page](http://rdic.org/ceramic-water-filters/)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.rdic.org/db/download/index.php)  \n[cambodian-filter-factories.pdf](/ast/32-cambodian-filter-factories.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Resource Development International\n\nMarc Hall  \nResource Development International  \nKandal  \nCambodia  \n+855 24 399 577  \n[marc@rdic.org](mailto:marc@rdic.org)  \n\n\n"

Because of its integrated water treatment plant, the device produces clean water from even contaminated rivers or sea water. \n\nDue to the use of solar energy, the device is completely self-sufficient and independent of any supply of electricity or gas. In case of fluctuating sunshine, a new type of storage technology enables the safe use of solar energy in medical technology. The device is consistent with CE regulations. It is intended for use in rural developing areas. \n\nAs the device is integrated into a rucksack (backpack) it can easily be carried to any remote region. The technical feasibility has been tested and proven by the University of Kassel in Germany. A functional prototype will be developed by the end of 2014. A technical prototype will be constructed one year later.

Conventional devices need a stable power supply and distilled water. Therefore, they are unsuitable for developing areas. This device will help eliminate the spread of disease. \n\nThe rucksacks will be sold to businesses, certain individuals and societies.

These can be potentially harmful, especially for those children without immediate access to emergency care. Doctors in clinics in under-resourced areas often travel between clinics and are unable to see patients on a regular basis - yet, they are the only health professionals trained to diagnosis pneumonia. With the Breath Abacus, however, allied health workers can simply slide the beads to count a child's respiration rate. The beads are color coded to determine the final diagnosis. An hourglass connected to the abacus counts down for one minute; if a red bead is counted before one minute is up, pneumonia can be diagnosed with high accuracy. The abacus can be constructed with local materials according to the image shown in the solution description.\n\n1600 pieces of the breath counter (with electronic timer instead of the sand timer) can be supplied at $10 per piece plus transport and packing charges.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nAbhay and Rani Bang have been researching and solving health issues in the Gadchiroli district of India for more than three decades.

It enables the cultivation of crops in hot and arid regions of the world. \n\nThe greenhouse process uses sunlight and seawater to enable the supply of food, energy and fresh water. Air ventilation, driven by prevailing winds is cooled, cleaned, sterilized and humidified by seawater evaporators. This creates a climate that enables crops to grow in areas which normally do not provide the right conditions due to high temperatures, a lack of fresh water or both. \n\nSince only pure water evaporates, the seawater is reduced to concentrated brine, which is further evaporated outside the greenhouse to yield salt and other minerals. Evaporating seawater and cooling the air in the process is simpler and less expensive than other desalination methods. Output from the Seawater Greenhouse is equal to or greater than more energy-intensive methods, as the volume of water lost through plant transpiration is reduced by tenfold. Plants that are not stressed by excessive transpiration grow faster and produce higher yields.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nDue to climate change, there is rising concern regarding overpopulation and unsustainable farming practices. The possible exhaustion of fresh water and food resources is a reality. \n\nThe concept of Seawater Greenhouse was first developed in 1991 from LightWorks Ltd in the United Kingdom. Initial stages of pilot research took place in the Canary Island of Tenerife in 1992, where positive outcomes drove the team to look towards other potential arid regions. \n\nThe second Seawater Greenhouse was constructed on Al-Aryam Island in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in 2000. Later, a third research and greenhouse facility was completed in 2004 near Muscat, Oman. These projects have received positive feedback, and have proven to increase profits in the farming of fruits, vegetable, herbs and flowers. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Canary Islands, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Australia   \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.seawatergreenhouse.com/index.html)  \n[Product page](http://www.seawatergreenhouse.com/process.html)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2014/06/greening-the-desert.cfm)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Seawater Greenhouse Ltd\n\nCharlie  Paton  \nSeawater Greenhouse Ltd  \nLondon  \nE8 1AB      \nUnited Kingdom  \n+44 (0)20 7249 3627       \n[charlie@seawatergreenhouse.com](mailto:charlie@seawatergreenhouse.com)  \n\n\n"

ShelterBox produces watertight plastic boxes which contain durable supplies meant to temporarily shelter and sustain a single family. A purpose-designed tent provides shelter. The box also contains blankets, a cookstove and utensils, children's toys and other supplies chosen for the disaster at hand. The entire unit weighs approximately 100 pounds and is easy to carry and transport. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nEvery year hundreds and thousands of families across the world lose everything when disasters strike. Through no fault of their own and often with no warning, families lose their homes, their possessions and their livelihoods. Every day they are faced with a battle for survival and our mission is to help them.\n\nWe provide emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies for families around the world who are affected by disasters at the time when they need it the most. Our Founder, Tom Henderson OBE, saw the humanitarian response in most disasters was in the form of food and medicine. Little or no assistance was being given in terms of safe, secure shelter to help families survive the first days, weeks and months as they try to rebuild their lives. ShelterBox was created to fill this void. \n\nSince our inception in 2000, we have responded to earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, landslides, typhoons and conflict, delivering emergency humanitarian aid to families in need on every continent.\n\nThe ShelterBox solution in disaster response is as simple as it is effective. We deliver the essentials a family needs to survive in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Each large, green ShelterBox is tailored to a disaster but typically contains a disaster relief tent for an extended family, blankets, water storage and purification equipment, cooking utensils, a stove, a basic tool kit, a children’s activity pack and other vital items.\n\nWe rely on public donations and could not operate without the generosity of people the world over. Our supporters constantly go the extra mile to help make a difference to the lives of families who survive disasters. We have had fundraisers climb Mount Kilimanjaro, row the Atlantic, cross India in a Tuk Tuk and even cycle 10,000 miles on a tandem. Every box we send out bears its own unique number so our donors can see where the box they have sponsored has gone. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.shelterbox.org/)  \n[Product page](http://www.shelterbox.org/about.php?page=9)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.shelterbox.org/news.php)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: ShelterBox\n\nShelterBox  \nHelston, Cornwall  \nTR13 0LW  \nUnited Kingdom  \n44(0)1326 569782  \n[info@shelterbox.org](mailto:info@shelterbox.org)  \n\n\n"

The Hunter is a top lit updraft gasifier (TLUD), powered by twigs, yard scrub, or any flammable biomass. TLUD’s stoves utilize a batch fed combustion chamber. It is simple to operate. Just top light it like a candle, no continuous feeding required.  Vent the chimney outdoors to eliminate all household emissions. Insert vertical positioned fuel into the combustion chamber; next place a little tinder on top and light. To fine tune your flame adjust the ventilation door at the bottom of the stove. You now have the capacity to eliminate all household emissions!\n\nThe Hunter is easy to light, easily adjusted, lightweight, and cooks very rapidly. Thin tight packed fuel produces a very rapid boil. In the event you want to slow the cooking process down (e.g. slow cooking with cast iron) add thicker, dense fuel into the combustion chamber. Dense material takes longer to burn, ideal for slow cooking. Combustion in the Hunter produces very little smoke or soot, if using dry fuel. At the end of cooking, invert the stove to dump out the small amount of fine ash residue from the bottom of the chamber. The Chimney is divided into 4 small sections to accommodate handling this lightweight, easy to mange stove (14 lbs). \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nTLUD technology has been around for over 100 years. Primary air passes through your fuel as it combusts in the combustion chamber and becomes carbon monoxide gas. The carbon monoxide gas is then burned and mixed with the preheated secondary air, above the fire. The secondary air combustion appearance is like a gas stove and is know as a Chinese burner. The end result of your biomass fuel is to produce minimal amounts of ash, soot, and bio-char, which is required to be removed from the stove after cooking for maximum stove performance.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Over 200 USD  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 305 x 305 x 406 mm  \nWeight: 6.59 kg  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.silverfire.us)  \n[Product page](http://www.silverfire.us/hunter-chimney-gasifier-stove)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: SilverFire\n\nTodd Albi  \nSilverFire  \nEugene, OR  \n97405  \nUnited States  \n541 222 9212  \n[todd.r.albi@gmail.com](mailto:todd.r.albi@gmail.com)  \n\n\n"

As the turbine is powered by kinetic energy and not with potential energy, it is also known as a “zero-head” or “in-stream” turbine. As such, no dams are necessary for the operation of this device. The course of a river remains unchanged and no large investments in infrastructure are required. \n\nMore cost-effective than diesel generators, the SMART Turbine operates on a low-cost per kilowatt basis making it not only ideal for industrialized countries, but also for decentralized electrification in emerging countries. To tackle specific problems of decentralized electrification, the product comes with an intelligent electrical management system allowing for a simple and efficient load management which is necessary for the implementation of micro grids.\n\nFor optimum operation, the SMART Turbine must be placed in a river or canal with at least two meters of depth, three meters of width and a flow rate of 1.2 meters per second. While the system does not require advanced technical expertise for operation or maintenance, occasional cleaning is necessary.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIn developing regions, rural communities often rely on costly and unsustainable diesel generators for electrification.  Solar power is partly replacing diesel engines, but requires expensive battery storage capacities. The SMART Turbine was developed to generate base-load electricity supplies to overcome these problems. With the availability of energy in rural areas, populations' productivity increases, which allows for their integration into local and national economies.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide   \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.smart-hydro.de/en/home.html)  \n[Product page](http://www.smart-hydro.de/en/product.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Smart Hydro Power GmbH\n\nKarl Kolmsee  \nSmart Hydro Power GmbH  \nFeldafing  \n82340  \nGermany  \n+49 8158 907897 11  \n[karl.kolmsee@smart-hydro.de](mailto:karl.kolmsee@smart-hydro.de)  \n\n\n"

FrontlineCloud makes life simpler with a quick set-up process, more ways to connect to mobile networks, and all of the sophisticated data management available through the cloud. It brings the convenience of the web to your text message communications, all for a low monthly rate.\n\nFrontlineCloud is a networked service that is hosted by FrontlineSMS for $10 per month.  Users can log into their account on the Frontline website from any computer and send messages online wherever there is internet access. The benefits of FrontlineCloud are speed and accessibility, as users can log in to their accounts from anywhere without bringing a modem and SIM card.\n\nMobile is everywhere. More than 3.5 billion people have mobile phones worldwide, and they send more than 22 billion SMS every day. Coordinating messages with the people you care about- staff, customers, fans or friends- can be challenging without the right set of tools. Mobile communications are increasingly fragmenting across different platforms, network operators, devices, and geography, making it more difficult to navigate using the world’s most accessible communication tool: SMS. FrontlineCloud allows a project in London to message farmers in Lusaka, or nurses in Kansas to text health workers in Karachi. Users can log in to send and receive SMS anywhere in the world at local prices, wherever they connect to the Internet. By combining the efficiencies, popularity and reach of SMS with the sophistication and billing structures of the web, FrontlineSMS and FrontlineCloud are tools for integrating mobile communication into multi-channel information management systems.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe Social Impact Lab Foundation worked to make Cloud as accessible as possible - the cost is as low as low as possible and only covers server hosting expenses.  FrontlineSMS tries to make it as accessible as humanly possible and accept payments in virtually any way - they are cognizant that many people don't have credit cards.\n\nPeople in last mile communities shouldn't necessarily be limited to last mile tools. As internet access becomes more and more widespread, the Social Impact Lab Foundation thinks its benefits should be democratized as much as possible. FrontlineCloud was built to straddle the worlds of Internet and SMS - you need an internet connection to administer the software, but you are still reaching your beneficiaries via SMS - delivering better, faster, cheaper information to people on whatever device they happen to have.  The communication platform - SMS - is still the same, FrontlineCloud is just a better and more economical way to deliver it.  Insofar as accessibility is a goal to strive for, FrontlineCloud overcomes common obstacles to connect people via SMS. Often times it is the case that those implementing the projects have a relatively stable internet connection, which they can leverage to send out more SMS and reach even more beneficiaries than would be possible with just the desktop version of FrontlineSMS.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.frontlinesms.com/technologies/frontlinecloud-overview/)  \n[Product page](http://cloud.frontlinesms.com)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Social Impact Lab Foundation\n\nSocial Impact Lab Foundation  \nWashington, DC  \n20006  \nUnited States  \n+1 646 460 5853  \n[info@frontlinesms.com](mailto:info@frontlinesms.com)  \n\n\n"

In its more severe form, this disorder is keeping otherwise healthy children and adults from going to school and working as they are considered deaf, even if they are not. The extent of hearing loss leads to poverty and hardship in the families and communities affected, and through extension, to the larger society. Those effected suffer from the lack of educational and occupational opportunities. People with disabilities account for a higher per cent age of unemployed than national average and have less access to education and training, as well as a higher incidence of HIV.\n\nThrough a Brazilian Foundation, Instituto CEFAC plus a social marketing organization Legar, plus several University stakeholders and in conjunction with the youths who are deaf, from an NGO in Africa, Solar Ear Brazil, manufactures, assembles and distributes, the first digital rechargeable hearing aid, a new solar battery charger and rechargeable hearing aid batteries which costs the same as disposible zinc air batteries, but lasts 2 to 3 years. All products are assembled by young employees who are deaf. By developing practical technologies for the region and creating employment, training and education programs, this project is a sustainable professional enterprise, as well as effect the way civil society views the skills of people with disabilities.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThis project will ultimately help the less advantaged children in Latin America get low cost hearing aids, which will enable those children to be mainstreamed in local schools. There are very few schools for the deaf in Latin America, especially rural areas. Article 26 of UN Charter on Human Rights, states \"everyone has the right to education.\" This project aims to give the hearing impaired child improved access to education system. The project will also empower and educate Solar Ear's employees who are deaf. These initial employees will act as role models, encouraging other unemployed hearing impaired or deaf students in their region.

The packages are light-weight, do not require a container and are thus easily transportable to remote, off-road areas – in extreme cases, on the back of donkeys.\n\nWhile certain parts of the kiosk (particularly the electrical components) will be manufactured centrally to ensure quality and durability, all others can be made of local materials such as bamboo, wood, adobe, stone, metal or even recycled goods. The kiosk will be assembled locally with local materials; it becomes accepted as a domestic product.\n\nAfter assembly, despite its light weight, the kiosk is safe and secure – an essential quality in communities where even the smallest products are of comparably high value. The entire structure is firmly anchored in the ground. Special detailing of all joints and assembly points on the inside of the building shell makes tinkering with the kiosk from the outside difficult.\n\nEvery SOLARKIOSK will provide enough power for solar lighting, mobile phone and car battery charging, a computer and even a solar fridge. Depending on local conditions, internet, TV and music can be offered as well. Since the SOLARKIOSK will most likely house the only fridge in the area, it can cool drinks and medication.

Consequently, urban households are totally dependent on markets for their food and are vulnerable to volatile food prices.\n\nSack Gardens allow people to grow short-cycle vegetables in sacks pierced with holes. Fully-grown leaves are collected once a week, and three sacks can provide three to four meals per week for a family of five. 80% of the produce is consumed directly, while the surplus is sold to cover the cost of other expenses such as children’s education. Women's and youth groups have come together around this innovative and inexpensive technique which not only has a high impact, but is also easy to reproduce.\n\nAmongst the positive impacts of the project is the fact that the risk of people, particularly women, being harassed or attacked on their way to the market has decreased since residents are no longer obliged to buy vegetables late in the day. Moreover, some groups and associations have decided to clean up waste disposal sites in order to clear space for the sack gardens, thus helping to improve living conditions in neighborhoods. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nFor over 30 years, the humanitarian aid organization SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL has been committed to providing aid in the event of conflict and natural disasters.

The solar cooker catches the sun and reflects its radiation in the center of the parabole, which is easily adjustable.\n\nA shell-shaped (parabolic) surface composed of polished aluminum reflects the sunlight to a central point in the solar cooker. In the middle is a metal baking tray (20 to 20 cm) with a black heat-resistant coating where the dish is placed. Because sunlight enters the solar cooker from four directions, the temperature in the heart of the solar oven rises quickly to 250°C. In the center of the unit, food can be cooked, baked, steamed or grilled.\n\nBecause it is a deep parabolic cooker, there is no risk of blinding or burning.

The mixture is first machine pressed into the correct flower pot mold, and is then fired using a traditional ceramic firing kiln. During firing, the rice husk combusts, leaving behind many 0.6-500 μm holes that physically remove contaminants from the water.\n \nThe fired filters are then coated with silver nitrate, which acts as a biocide against the residual bacteria that may flow through.  The safe water storage reservoir prevents recontamination of treated water.

It is based on an indigenous technology that can easily be constructed using local labor and materials. It also provides health benefits by allowing for the safe disposal of human excreta on-site, without requiring people to manually remove waste. It consists of a pan with a steep slope of 25°-28° and a specially-designed trap with a 20mm water seal. The toilet only requires 1-1.5 liters of water for flushing, thus helping to conserve water. \n\nThere are two pits of varying size and capacity depending on the number of users.  The capacity of each pit is normally designed for three years’ usage. Both pits are used alternately. When one pit is full, the incoming excreta is diverted into the second pit. In about two years, the sludge is digested and becomes almost dry and pathogen free, thus safe for handling as manure. Digested sludge is odorless and works as a manure and soil-conditioner. It can be dug out easily and used for agricultural purposes. The cost of emptying the pit can be met partially from the cost of manure made available. The Sulabh toilet can also be constructed on the upper floors of buildings. It has a high potential for up-gradation, and can later be easily connected to sewers when introduced in the area. Sulabh has so far constructed over one million individual household toilets in different parts of India.\n\nThere are twelve different models of the Sulabh Shauchalaya, which can serve a range of 5-10 people for 2-10 years  Models begin at 15 USD and can be constructed by local workers using locally-sourced materials.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nSulabh International Social Service Organization, a non-profit voluntary social organization founded in 1970 by Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak, is dedicated to the Gandhian ideology of emancipation of 'scavengers', a section of Indian society condemned to clean and carry human excreta manually.

There are also practical problems in re-treating nets in remote areas, a long way from the urban centres where stocks of insecticide and trained advisors are located. \n\nSumitomo Chemical engineers set about developing the first net that does not need this constant re-treatment. The process begins with insecticide-impregnated beads, which are extruded into fiber and warped onto bobbins to be knitted into rolls of netting.\n\nThe netting rolls are cut into sized panels which are machine-stitched into the nets themselves. Chemical and physical checks are made before the nets are sent for delivery by land, sea and air. Because the insecticide is incorporated within the fibers, Olyset Nets are truly ready-to-use, long-lasting and never in need of treatment. Washing does not diminish their effectiveness, and they have been shown to still repel mosquitoes seven years after initially being put into use.\n\nKey features: \n\n-Guaranteed to last at least five years. Research indicates that a seven-year life is often achievable.\n-Tough – Olyset Net uses polyethylene technology that makes the net stronger and more tear resistant than polyester nets.\n-Controlled release technology – unlike polyester nets, the insecticide in Olyset Net is contained within the fibre, not coated on the outside. This technology provides a slow release of the active ingredient which continues to control mosquitoes for more than five years.\n-Quadruple insecticide effect on mosquitoes – bite inhibition, repellency, knockdown, kill. All contribute to protection from biting mosquitoes and other insects.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nSumitomo Chemical pioneered a technology to develop a net that effectively prevents mosquito biting, lasts for a long time and resists both washing and tearing. Olyset Net incorporates the insecticide permethrin into the actual fibers of the net, and releases it slowly over a number of years. \n\nOlyset Net passed the rigorous testing procedure known as WHOPES (World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme). This involved extensive laboratory and field studies held under scientific scrutiny, and a commitment to quality assurance through the publication of agreed specifications. Olyset Net was the first LLIN to pass WHOPES and earn WHO’s recommendation. \n\nOlyset Net is a crucial tool in the fight against malaria - and was the first WHO-recommended LLIN to be manufactured in Africa, where a child dies from malaria every 30 seconds. Production in Africa began in 2003 when Sumitomo Chemical provided a royalty-free technology license to A to Z Textile Mills in Arusha, Tanzania. Tanzanian production was further expanded in 2008 when Sumitomo Chemical celebrated the official opening of a 50:50 joint venture factory, expanding our partnership with A to Z in East Africa. In 2009, Olyset Net production capacity in Arusha will exceed 29 million nets a year -- more than half of the global Olyset Net output. \n\nIn June 2009, Sumitomo Chemical opened an Olyset Net stitching factory in Kombolcha, Ethiopia, which will produce 3 million Olyset Nets in its first year of operation. Read more. \n\nOlyset Net is a part of Sumitomo Chemical's corporate social responsibility program, and our commitment to helping the people of Africa is recognized internationally. Olyset Net production in Tanzania employs more than 5,000 people, and supports over 25,000 people in the vicinity of the factories.

Food can be boiled, steamed, roasted or baked at cooking temperatures of 360° F / 182° C, suitable for cooking the majority of foods in the developing world. The Appliance weighs only 21 pounds / 9.5 kg and has a life span of more than 20 years.\n\nGLOBAL SUN OVENS® are designed to be as energy efficient as possible, maximising energy to achieve the highest possible temperature and retain highest amount of heat possible, while minimizing weight and negative impacts on the environment. The annual wood consumption for cooking throughout developing countries is 1,000 pounds of wood per person. A family of six using a GLOBAL SUN OVEN® for 80% of their cooking needs would save 4,800 pounds of wood per year, and prevent over 88 tons of CO2 emissions tbeing released into the earth's atmosphere, over the oven's 20 year lifespan. \n\nOther than cleaning, no other ongoing maintenance is required.\n\nDue to their durability, ability to be used when there is less sun and the fact that food can be cooked faster, means the GLOBAL SUN OVEN® are less expensive on a cost per meal basis than other solar cooking devices. The high quality materials that are required to make a GLOBAL SUN OVEN® make its initial cost higher but its overall cost lower than any other solar cooking device. In areas where people can not afford to purchase an oven outright micro-finance programs are utilized to allow ovens to be paid in small installments using money that would have otherwise been spent purchasing charcoal.\n\nThe price of GLOBAL SUN OVEN® can be reduced by assembling them in the countries in which they will be used. SUN OVENS International has developed a local assembly plant system, enabling GLOBAL SUN OVEN® to be made in the area they will be used, dramatically reducing the cost of the ovens and shipping. This complete assembly system includes the training, tools, instructional materials and follow-up support necessary.\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nOver 2 billion people cook with wood, charcoal or dung as their primary cooking fuel and the social, economic and environmental impacts are significant. The GLOBAL SUN OVEN® has been engineered to provide an alternative to using wood and dung, fuels that are becoming increasingly scarce and costly. The use of these solar ovens can be very beneficial to women all over the world by reducing the cost of fuel and/or lightening the everyday burdens of life.\n\nNGO's that have worked with SUN OVEN® have found that they have had an easier time getting people to use them because these solar ovens work so well and maintain cooking temperatures that are significantly higher than other types of solar devices.\n\n\n\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Afghanistan, Haiti, Nepal, South Africa, North Korea, Dominican Republic, other  \nPrice (USD): 299  \nAvailable online: yes  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: yes  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nWeight: 9.5kg  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.sunoven.com)  \n[Product page](http://www.sunoven.com/international/global-sun-oven.php)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/genevasun/business/2020608,2_1_AU31_OVENS_S1-100131.article)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: SUN OVENS International, Inc. \n\nSUN OVENS International, Inc.   \nElburn, IL  \n60119  \nUSA  \n+1 630 208 7273  \n[info@sunoven.com](mailto:info@sunoven.com)  \n\n\n"

Using the energy-efficient LED technology, it allows for an affordable system, which is also modular and expandable according to the consumer's needs. Starting typically with one system consisting of a small solar panel connected to a Ulitium lamp, the system can be expanded by adding more panels and lamps as required. The configuration can be as large as the user desires, spanning across the entire home. A Lithium battery pack is housed inside each Ulitium lamp, thus eliminating the need for a centralized controller and tedious maintenance. Because the energy consumption of the Ulitium is very low, it does not require large solar panels, making the Sundaya Ulitium range the best choice for solar DC lighting in the years to come.\n\n\nMain features:\n\n1) 240 Lumen light output (equal to 7W CFL bulb or 40W incandescent bulb).\n\n2) 23% efficiency (compared to 1% for incandescent and 5% for CFL).\n\n3) Built-in Energy Storage (60kJ) and management electronics (no need for separate battery and controller anymore). Solar panel plugs in directly to the lamp through a Hub (which provides lightning surge protections).\n\n4) Dimmable from 240 Lumen, down to 120 Lumen, 25 Lumen, and off position, by integrated pull-switch.\n\n5) Extremely low energy consumption:\n    a. 8kJ/h @ 240Lm\n    b. 4kJ/h @ 120Lm\n    c. 1kJ/h @ 25Lm\n\n6) Long battery life:\n    a. 7,500h @ 8kJ/h (240Lm), equal to 3.4 years @ 6h/day\n    b. 15,000h @ 4kJ/h (120Lm), equal to 6.8 years @ 6h/day\n7) Extremely long life of light-chips:\n    a. 20,000h @ 240Lm, equal to 9 years @ 6h/day\n    b. 40,000h @ 240Lm, equal to 18 years @ 6h/day\n\n8) Can be charged with very small solar panel of 50kJ/day (3Wp):\n    a. 240Lm > 50kJ / 8kJ/h = 6h of light per day\n    b. 120Lm > 50kJ / 4kJ/h = 12h of light per day\n\n9) System expandable from 1 lamp to 10 or 100 lamps, simply by adding and connecting more panels and lamps.\n\n10) System can be added by a Sundaya LCD Color TV with same built-in Energy Storage technology.\n\n11) Automatic regulation of energy between devices that are connected to same PV panel (or array of panels).

The DC current is collected by the wiring in the panel. The current is either used to supply a DC pump, which pumps water whenever the sun shines, or the current is stored in batteries (for a battery-coupled pumping system). All the pumped water is stored in a water tank so that there is a constant water supply, even in bad weather conditions and at night when there is insufficient power to generate the solar water pumps.\n\nA solar-powered water pump differs from a regular water pump only in that it uses the sun's energy to supply electricity for the pump. Solar-powered water pumps represent a higher initial investment; however, over a period of five years they offer cost benefits due to zero fuel costs and minimal maintenance costs compared to AC pumps that run with a diesel-powered generator.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nSunlabob Renewable Energy is a Laos-based company specializing in renewable energy and clean water solutions throughout the developing world.

The SunSaluter is assembled by attaching a solar panel onto a stand built out of bamboo or wood, metal fittings, and a metal arm that acts like a scale.\n\nAt the beginning of the day, a user fills up two water containers to be used as a weight on one side of the metal arm and a counterweight on the other. After setting up the water containers, the water slowly drips out of the containers through a tube, which can be attached to a water filter. This slow drip creates a slow shift in weight, so throughout the day, the solar panel changes position and tilts as the sun moves across the sky, and the water drips out of the containers. This makes the solar panel perpendicular to the sun all day as it moves from sunrise to sunset.\n\nAt the end of the day, when the sun is down, the water has completely dripped out of the containers and through the filter, creating clean water. As a result, the solar panel has harvested 30% more energy from the sun by remaining perpendicular to the sun all day.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nDeveloped over the course of many years by Eden Full, the first SunSaluters were deployed to Kenya in 2010.

The program has been developed by Tata Consultancy Services, Asia's largest software enterprise. The CBFL program uses a mix of methods to teach an uneducated person how to read in a fraction of the time that it takes to do this by conventional means (50 hours instead of 200 hours). These methods include:\n- Teaching software\n- Multimedia presentations\n- Printed material\n\nThe project employs animated graphics and a voiceover to explain how individual alphabets combine to give structure and meaning to various words. The TCS course, which uses puppets as the motif in the teaching process, has been designed from material developed by the National Literacy Mission, established by the Indian government in 1988 with the aim of eradicating adult illiteracy in the country. The mission's lessons, which have been deeply researched and formulated, are tailored to fit different languages and even dialects.\n\nWith an emphasis on learning words rather than alphabets, the project addresses thought processes with the objective of teaching these words in as short a time span as possible.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIlliteracy is often synonymous with poverty. The written word can go a long way in empowering the less privileged. Traditionally it requires 200 hours of instruction--up to two years--to make a person literate. This leads to a high dropout rate. Convinced that economic development is related to literacy, TCS worked on a paradigm shift that would impact the 260 million illiterate in India. CBFL is a corporate-wide initiative started in the year 2000 to address and overcome impediments of literacy through information technology.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](https://www.tcsion.com/dotcom/ALP/index.html)  \n[Product page](https://www.tcsion.com/dotcom/ALP/About.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Tata Consultancy Services\n\nTata Consultancy Services  \nMumbai  \n400 021  \nIndia  \n+91 (022) 6778 9999  \n[corporate.cbfl@tcs.com ](mailto:corporate.cbfl@tcs.com )  \n\n\n"

RO can be customised to address arsenic, nitrate, sulphate and other chemical contamination.\n\nRO technology uses a membrane that is semi-permeable, which allows only pure water to pass through it. During the process it rejects large contaminants passing through the membrane. Quality RO systems use a process known as ‘crossflow’ which allows the membrane to continually clean itself. RO requires a driving force to push the fluid through the membrane and as some of the fluid passes through, the rest continues downstream, thereby sweeping the rejected contaminants away from the membrane.\n\nThe unit that is skid-mounted and designed for indoor installation comprises a raw water pump that supplies water to the micron cartridge water filtration system and to the high pressure pump. Micron cartridge filters control the silt density before water enters into the membrane whereas high pressure pump exists to boost water pressure as required.\n\nAdvantages:- RO technology has a proven record to reduce/treat contamination related to fluoride/salinity and other chemicals.- It eliminates water from suspended solids, major inorganic pollutants like acids, salts, toxic metals and most of the organic micro pollutants including aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides and toxins.- The model has a throughput of 200 litres to 2,000 litres per hour and ensures quality safe drinking water for a village size of 2,000 to 10,000 population (the capacity can further go up).- Incurs low maintenance costs.- Easy to operate and maintain.\n\n\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nTata Projects partnered with the Naandi Foundation,  a non profit organisation in India, to install RO technology in several villages in India providing clean drinking water to 400,000 villagers.\n\nMore information about this project can be found on the Naandi Foundation website:\nhttp://www.naandi.org/provide_drinking_water/makewatermore_2b.aspx\n\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: India  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.tataprojects.com)  \n[Product page](http://www.naandi.org/provide_drinking_water/ReverseOsmosis.aspx)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.creativ-entrepreneur.com/?page_id=1858&lang=en)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Tata Projects\n\nDipankar Chatterjee  \nTata Projects  \nSECUNDERABAD  \n500003  \nIndia  \n+91 40 66 23 88 01  \n[dipankarc@tataprojects.com](mailto:dipankarc@tataprojects.com)  \n\n\n"

This meant that girls feared stigmatization due to soiling themselves while in school. Further research during field trials revealed that about 90% of the urban poor women and girls did not use (off-the-shelf) sanitary pads because they were expensive but improvised with unhealthy materials such as banana fibers, grass, leaves, old newspapers, and pieces of cloth.\n\nIn response to this, the project at Makerere University's Faculty of Technology now manufactures sanitary pads which are 75% cheaper and thus more affordable to the rural primary school girls who have started their menstruation. The sanitary pads (trademarked Makapads) are the first to be made from 99% local materials with the main raw material being papyrus reeds, cut from the vast, abundant swamps and riverbanks all over the country.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: East Africa  \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.t4tafrica.co)  \n[Product page](http://www.t4tafrica.co/makapads)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=5264&catid=510&typeid=24&subMenuId=0)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Technology for Tomorrow\n\nDr. Moses Musazi  \nTechnology for Tomorrow  \nKampala  \nUganda  \n+256 41 4597114  \n[info@t4tafrica.co](mailto:info@t4tafrica.co)  \n\n\n"

Most commonly, wood is collected from forests and burned in stoves for cooking and other processes. TIDE aims to improve the efficiency of cooking stoves, and reduce the need for biomass fuel, and its resultant emissions.\n\nTIDE designs improved stoves tailored to the needs of different consumers. Most designs include the same features: improved internal geometry to maximize heat transfer and minimize heat loss, better internal insulation, and chimney to take pollution away from the user's surroundings. \n\nEntrepreneurs sell these products locally, and offer service for one year. After that, service and repairs can be made for a fee. The life of the stove, given proper use and basic maintenance, is about 5 years.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nStoves are manufactured locally, using as many locally-available materials as possible. To improve quality control, some improved water-heating stoves are manufactured by Phoenix Products, which can install 300 units per year.\n\nRight now, TIDE is providing stoves to many states in the South of India. Depending on the application of the stove, the price varies. A silk-reeling stove costs Rs2,000; a 100-litre water boiler Rs15,000; an improved stove for Rs17,000.

It is operated by a foot lever and thus reduces the chance for the transmission of pathogens as the user only touches a bar of soap suspended by a string.  Adequate hand washing with the Tippy Tap requires only 40 milliliters of water as compared to an average of 500 milliliters by using a cup or mug. Additionally, used gray water can be recycled for watering plants. \n\nThe Tippy Tap can be made with locally-sourced materials at virtually no cost. The basic set of required materials includes several sticks, string, soap and a container for the water.  The device is especially effective when strategically placed outside of latrines, kitchens and schools.  \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe Tippy Tap was first introduced by Dr. Jim Watt in Zimbabwe, who originally employed a gourd instead of a plastic water container.  Since its introduction, the Tippy Tap has been adopted as a user-friendly way to encourage effective hand washing behavior in developing communities.  \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.tippytap.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.tippytap.org/the-tippy-tap)  \n[how-to-build-a-tippy-tap-manual.pdf](/ast/595-how-to-build-a-tippy-tap-manual.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: TippyTap.org\n\nTippyTap.org  \nNew York City, NY  \nUnited States  \n[tippytap.org@gmail.com](mailto:tippytap.org@gmail.com)  \n\n\n"

Adults miss work due to sickness and girls miss school because they lack a private bathroom. Rising sea levels and the increasing frequency of flooding due to climate change are putting even more communities at risk.  \n\nThe CRAPPER (Compact, Rotating, Aerobic, Pollution Prevention, Excreta Reducer), a self-contained waterless composting toilet, uses efficient aerobic decomposition to reduce volume and eliminate odors and pathogens in waste before it enters the ground. The CRAPPER’s core technology, a rotating horizontally-mounted drum, has been the industry standard in the USA since the 1970’s, at an average cost of around $1500.  By utilizing inexpensive, locally sourced yet resilient materials, the CRAPPER only costs $200 per-unit. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nToilets for People founder, Jason Kass, was on an Engineers Without Borders mission to install double-vault latrines in rural El Salvador when early rains washed away the roads and hopes of a materials delivery. Determined to build the promised toilets, he thought of the $1500+ off-the-shelf composting toilet at his Vermont home and attempted to replicate it with local materials. Three days later they had a prototype for The CRAPPER and the idea for Toilets for People was born. Toilets for People has conducted pilot toilet installations in Haiti, Peru, Senegal, Nicaragua and El Salvador. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti, Mexico, Peru, Senegal  \nAvailable online: yes  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: India, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti, Mexico, Peru, Senegal  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 30 inches long, 27 inches high and 18 inches wide (24\" wide for squat toilet version).  \nWeight: Made from Plywood, 100 pounds.

There is a plastic diffuser plate above the water level to avoid disturbing the naturally occurring bio-layer. It is the bio-layer which holds the key bacteria essential to removing biological pathogens and parasites. Water travels through the layer of biologically active sand and gravel which traps and degrades sediment, parasites and 98% bacteria.\n\nOperation and maintenance is simple and within the capabilities of any user. Water poured through the filter processes at a rate of .6 liters per minute, which provides sufficient water fast enough to keep up with a family’s demand for clean water. Each filter can optimally filter 50 to 80 liters of water per day.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nThe availability of potable water is decreasing as the world’s population increases.

As a mechanical and biomedical engineer, Aaron recognized the kinetic energy that was being wasted as his backpack rubbed against his shoulders and hips with every step. He also had to stop at towns along the way to buy disposable batteries to keep his devices running.  It was during this trip in 1996 when Aaron began thinking of ways to capture this energy and create usable electricity to charge hand-held electronic devices.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice (USD): $159.99  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 9\" tall, Top & Bottom Cylinders: 1'\" diameter, Center Cylinder: 1.5\" diameter  \nWeight: 11 oz.  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.npowerpeg.com/)  \n[Product page](http://www.npowerpeg.com/learn-more)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Tremont Electric\n\nTremont Electric  \nCleveland, Ohio  \n44113  \nUSA  \n888-214-3137  \n[info@npowerpeg.com](mailto:info@npowerpeg.com)  \n\n\n"

They are based on the Scheffler type, as they are built of steel sections presenting 16 m² of highly reflective aluminum.   Powered by a sensor-controlled motor, the reflector rotates, following the course of the sun and focusing its light on the one point throughout the year. This focus collects the sunlight and therefore reaches temperatures, which exceed 1000 °C. Depending on the seasons, the reflector is configured to the angle of the sun at two levers very simply by hand. The system is transportable. \n\nThe concentrated energy can be used for heating a plate of about 1 m² or an oven to 180-250 °C in about an hour. The temperature is kept constant by an integrated stone core. Further, it can be used to generate steam as an energy source, as several combined reflectors can vaporize water in an absorber that is connected to a pressure tank (to max 10 bars).  \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Mexico  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](https://sites.google.com/site/trinysol/trinysol)  \n[Product page](https://sites.google.com/site/trinysol/trinysol)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: TrinySol\n\nTrinySol  \nHidalgo  \nMexico  \n772 123 7010  \n[info@trinysol.com](mailto:info@trinysol.com)  \n\n\n"

When cooking with wood fuel or other fuels such as dung or crop residuals, it produces additional electrical energy through the combustion heat. Using the electro-acoustic effect with the help of an innovative device, powerful sound waves are produced in combination with a linear electrical generator. The sound emitted by the stove is no louder than a hum.\n\nThe electricity produced by the Score Stove can be used to charge 12 V batteries or to provide main AC voltage. The Score Stove uses 30 to 50% less wood than the conventional 3 stone stove, thus, reducing deforestation.\n\nThe Score Stove may help to provide small-scale electricity generation to areas where supply is limited. As the stove traps the heat and smoke which are produced by the fire, it reduces the amount of smoke that escapes into the air and therefore minimizes negative health effects for the families. It also has a positive environmental effect, as the stove consumes much less wood than a normal 3 stone fire stove, thanks to its energy-saving design. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\n2.7 billion people still depend on firewood, charcoal, dung, and crop residues for their daily cooking and heating. The health risks of the traditional cooking practices should not be underestimated: Rudimentary wood-fired cook stoves and open fires emit fine particles, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants at levels up to 100 times higher than the recommended limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2011).\n\nThe Score Stove will be adapted for the use of liquid paraffin as many rural communities in Africa are still highly dependent on it.

UoPeople’s mission strives to provide access to undergraduate degree programs for qualified individuals, despite financial, geographic or societal constraints. Currently, UoPeople offers Associate (2-year) and Bachelor (4-year) degree programs in Business Administration and Computer Science. Students must demonstrate English proficiency in order to apply, but introductory English language courses are offered to qualified applicants who do not meet this requirement. Applicants are required to submit an one-time application of $10-$50, based on the student’s native country and economic background. Administrative fees to cover exam processing are covered by a $100 fee per each course. Applicants in need may apply for scholarships.\n\nIn line with other online education platforms, UoPeople operates on a limited budget, employs collaborative and open-source e-learning tools, and hosts online study communities where students share resources and discuss weekly topics. However, UoPeople is distinct in that it offers specific degrees to a selected class. The inaugural class, which began courses in 2009, consisted of 177 students from 49 countries. A community of educators comprised of active and retired professors, librarians, master-level students and other professionals participate in the educational activity and oversee the assessment process of this tuition-free online education model. Former presidents of New York University, the University of Oxford, and the Indian Institute of Technology sit on UoPeople’s President’s Council, a team that works closely with UoPeople’s founder to bring together decades of experience and advance the mission of UoPeople. Successful UoPeople graduates have gone on to programs at world-renowned institutions such as New York University-Abu Dhabi, demonstrating the strength and integrity of UoPeople’s educational partnerships.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nUniversity of the People was founded in 2009 by educational entrepreneur Shai Reshef. As of 2012, UoPeople has partnered with Yale University for research, New York University to accept students from its degree programs, and Hewlett-Packard, in conjunction with the Catalyst Initiative, for student internships. To date, students from more than 130 countries have been accepted to UoPeople. Reshef himself has 20 years of experience in the international education market. From 1989 to 2005, he served as Chairman of the Kidum Group, a for-profit educational services company. Between 2001 and 2004, Reshef also chaired KIT eLearning, the online learning partner of the University of Liverpool and the first online university outside of the United States. In just the past three years, UoPeople has gained numerous distinctions that are recognized worldwide. In 2009, Reshef was listed among the100 Most Creative People in Business by Fast Company and has been awarded an Ashoka fellowship. Press giants such as Business Week, NPR, and the Huffington Post have all touted UoPeople’s success.

These problems can be corrected with a pair of eyeglasses.\n\nThe replicable program relies on public school teachers to identify students with potential visual acuity problems. A specialized optometric examination is directly carried out in schools by a team of optometrists from “Ver Bien para Aprender Mejor”. As a result of this examination, the optometrist delivers a personal prescription for every student with visual problems.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nIn 1997 a survey conducted by the Ministry of Education of Mexico showed that approximately 12.7% of the children in public Elementary and Junior High schools suffered visual acuity problems.\n\nIf vision problems are not detected in childhood they can have a direct and negative impact on children’s family and social integration. Good vision and the learning process go hand in hand. A child with visual problems does not learn and does not understand, thus self-esteem and school performance are affected and it can result in school dropouts. \n\nA group of entrepreneurs in coordination with the Ministry of Education, established the Program “Ver Bien para Aprender Mejor” (Good Vision to Learn Better) to face visual acuity problems that affect the learning capability and the dropout of students.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Mexico  \nPrice range (USD): Free  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.verbien.org.mx/english.html)  \n[Product page](http://www.verbien.org.mx/english.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: VerBien\n\nVerBien  \nMexico City  \nC.P.01000  \nMexico  \n(55) 36 01 39 34  \n[comunicacion@verbien.org.mx](mailto:comunicacion@verbien.org.mx)  \n\n\n"

Wecyclers uses a fleet of low-cost cargo bicycles to offer convenient household recycling service in densely populated low-income neighborhoods. We motivate families to recycle plastic bottles, plastic sachets, and aluminum cans through our SMS-based incentive program. For every kilogram of material that families recycle with us, they receive redeemable Wecyclers points over their cell phones in return. Families can then redeem their points for goods that they value, such as cell phone minutes, basic food items, and household goods. Families receive collection reminders and rewards updates directly on their mobile phones making the benefits of recycling immediate.\n\nAfter collection, Wecyclers aggregates the material at the household level to sell to local recycling processors. Wecyclers provides a consistent supply of well-sorted, high quality recyclable material to processors alleviating their supply constraints.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nLagos, Nigeria faces a sobering waste crisis that will only worsen as the city’s population of 18 million people continues to soar. The overburdened municipal government collects only 40% of city garbage and a mere 13% of recyclable materials are salvaged from landfills. People living in slum conditions without formal waste collection are subject to increased flooding, disease spread, and psychological stress that results from unmanaged trash heaps.  Concurrently, recycling firms in Lagos face a supply constraint—they cannot access and adequate supply of quality materials to process.

Fetching water in developing countries is very time-consuming, especially if much water is needed. Using conventional pumps, an average of 5 to 6 gallons per-minute can be pumped from shallow wells. The depth is also limited by the physical power a human can exert in lifting the column of water, which practically is around 230 feet.\n\nThe WaterBuck Pump is a powerful and efficient shallow and deep-well hand pump. The pump is designed to operate the same reciprocating lift pumps as those used in the windmill industry. The mechanics of this unique pump are unlike any conventional water well hand pump, enabling an operator to pump volumes of water from shallow wells with the same effort over conventional manual lift pumps. Practical amounts of water can now be pumped from much greater depths (700 feet is anticipated) under human power. Time spent pumping water needed for daily use can be greatly reduced.\n\nThe limits of the WaterBuck Pump are not yet known considering its newness and a wide variety of applications. However, in comparison to other powerful non-electric pumps with the same application, the WaterBuck exceeds the peak capacity of a 12-foot-diameter windmill by 60%.\n\nThe WaterBuck Pump is a water supply system for communities that have static water levels up to 200 feet with a capacity of up to 55 gallons per-minute. It can also pump uphill, supply water for furrow irrigation and pressurize tanks for drip irrigation or indoor plumbing. The pump can be adapted to accommodate a second lever and twin cylinders, allowing capacity to double with two to four operators pumping simultaneously.  A manual well pump of this caliber can be a great long-term asset for off-grid homesteaders and communities in developing countries. \n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nWithin the United States, an increasing number of individuals and communities are choosing to live off-grid for a variety of reasons of economics, privacy and self-sufficiency. The cost of electric power continues to rise and many fear an eventual end to the availability of affordable power.\n\nWell WaterBoy Products designed and built a prototype hand pump machine during the 2012 drought because common manual pumps are not adequate to supply the water needed from a deep well. Since then, the pump has been greatly improved upon and made ready for market.\n\nThe WaterBuck is manufactured with industrial-grade mechanics, weighing about 425 pounds, and is built to last for generations. Unlike alternative energy systems, it does not rely on advanced technology and is much less susceptible to theft, vandalism and catastrophic damage. The system requires only simple, easy maintenance.\n\nField testing the WaterBuck yielded 22 gallons per-minute with one operator drawing water from 80 feet. The yield is even greater with two operators. In another test, a 64-year-old woman pumped 7 gallons per-minute, also from the same application. \n\nThe WaterBuck Pump is currently manufactured and sold solely in the United States. However, it is a goal of Well WaterBoy Products to make the pump available in developing countries. \n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: USA  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n---- #specifications ----\n\nDimensions: 6' 2'' x 22'' x 20''  \nWeight: 425 lb  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.waterbuckpump.com)  \n[Product page](http://waterbuckpump.com/main/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Well WaterBoy Products\n\nDarren Holliday  \nWell WaterBoy Products  \nCouch, Missouri  \nUSA  \n417-938-4991  \n[ products@waterbuckpump.com](mailto: products@waterbuckpump.com)  \n\n\n"

The resulting prototype is the WaterWheel 2.0.\n\nWomen spend over 25% of their time each day collecting water. With the WaterWheel, they can now transport 50L at once – between 3 and 5 times the amount of water possible as compared to traditional methods.\n\nThe WaterWheel’s cap-in-cap design prevents recontamination at the point of use.

It’s designed to be long lasting and handle the roughest terrain.\n\nThe WaterWheel’s form was inspired by the shape of the traditional matka – designed to be both aesthetically pleasing and a clear indication of the WaterWheel’s intended purpose (clean water!).\n\nIn recognition of the fact that the people who need the WaterWheel the most have the least ability to pay for it, Wello developed a business model that will enable them to offer the WaterWheel at an affordable price. Local manufacturing (in Ahmedabad, India) and CSR partnerships help us keep costs as low as possible.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nWello Water is a social venture with a bold mission: to effectively deliver clean water to a thirsty world.\n\nBy reframing the water crisis as an opportunity, Wello has reinvented the wheel and developed a business model that empowers individuals to use the WaterWheel as an income-generating tool to lift their families out of poverty.\n\nBy giving people easier access to potable water, the WaterWheel frees up valuable time, and in the process, removes barriers that prevent children from going to school and empowers women to engage in more productive activities. Research shows that when women have extra time, they choose to spend it on activities that boost family income, education, health, and wellbeing. Women with even a few years of education have smaller, healthier families, and are more likely to send their children to school. Female education is a key means of breaking the cycle of poverty.\n\nThe WaterWheel is available in India.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): 20 to 50 USD  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://wellowater.org/)  \n[Product page](http://wellowater.org/products.html)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Wello Water\n\nWello Water  \nMumbai  \nIndia  \n+91 7045 052 920  \n[hello@wellowater.org](mailto:hello@wellowater.org)  \n\n\n"

You kick-start the cooking process by heating your pot of food on the stove, then place it in the Wonderbag.\n\nWonderbag's insulating properties allow food that has been brought to the boil to finish cooking while in the bag. This greatly reduces the use of additional energy. This means families can cook hot meals while saving energy and money. It also means less time tending to the cooking food. Now time can be better spent looking after children, earning an income or doing essential chores.  The slowed cooking process, combined with sealing the pot in the Wonderbag, ensures the flavours and nutrients are retained inside the pot - not evaporated into thin air.\n\nBenefits:\n- Can reduce a family's fuel usage up to 30% - saving money and easing poverty\n- Reduces CO2 emissions\n- Reduces toxic fumes which means less respiratory problems and other diseases, particularly in children\n- Reduces accidents in the kitchen, because stoves are used less\n- Reduces time spent cooking, giving more time for child-care and other activities\n- Saves water: when the pot is insulated in a Wonderbag at a fairly constant temperature, less evaporation occurs, so less water is needed\n- Saves food: 20% of all staple food in Africa is burned, due to pots being placed on open fires and unregulated stove tops. With Wonderbag, no burning occurs.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): 50 to 100 USD  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://nb-wonderbag.com/Pages/Default)  \n[Product page](http://nb-wonderbag.com/Pages/WhatsAWonderbagSubpage)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Wonderbag\n\nWonderbag  \nUmhlanga  \n4319  \nSouth Africa  \n+27 31 536 8220  \n[enquiries@nb-wonderbag.com](mailto:enquiries@nb-wonderbag.com)  \n\n\n"

Kenyan adolescent girls miss approximately 3.5 million learning days per month due to lack of funds to purchase sanitary pads. This impedes their ability to compete in the classroom, leads to low self-esteem, higher drop-out rates and, in many areas of Kenya, makes them vulnerable to early marriage. \n\nZanaA has found a long-term and holistic solution to this problem, which is to establish a sustainable business creating locally-produced, environmentally-safe sanitary pads in Kenya while advocating for greater policy support of girls. \n\nFirst, ZanaA plans to coordinate, on-line, the national distribution of sanitary pads, to ensure all vendors are distributing proper sanitary pads and with synchronized training in sanitary pad use and disposal as well as age-appropriate sexual maturation education.\n\nThis will help reduce the logistical burden of sanitary pad distribution, ensure sexual predators are not given entry to the school, distribute pads at the convenience of the school curriculum, enable equitable distribution across the country, and reduce the cost burden to donors. Along with this comes the development of a tool kit for enhancing policy around girls and education.\n\nSecond, ZanaA has become the exclusive distributor to the informal market (including school girls) for a sanitary pad invented by Dr. Musaazi of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, called MakaPads™, made from local, easily replenishable natural resources.\n\nMakaPads has been approved by the Ugandan Bureau of Standards, is in the final stage of registering with the Kenyan Bureau of Standards, and is pending international patent. This is the first of several solutions, to provide sanitary pad production opportunities using available natural resources.\n\nThird, ZanaA is interesting in networking with any producers of sanitary pads and any organizations who provide or who are planning to provide sanitary pads to schools because the world can handle many solutions for different contexts. We are particularly interested in leveraging agricultural waste.\n\n---- #history-and-development ----\n\nAlongside product innovation, conversations have been started with networks of women’s groups regarding sales of pads to women at the bottom of the pyramid, and with NGOs to buy to distribute to school girls. Using a “salesmoms” sales force, ZanaA will help to keep limited financial resources within communities rather than going to a small group of shareholders in the West at the expense of Kenya’s systematic growth.\n\n---- #availability ----\n\nPublicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Kenya  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Keyna  \n\n\n---- #additional-information ----\n\n[Website](http://www.zanaa.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.zanaafrica.org/our-vision/timeline/making-pads-2/)  \n\n\n\n\n---- #provider ----\nname: Zana Africa\n\nMegan White Mukuria  \nZana Africa  \nNairobi  \nKenya  \n[contactus@zanaafrica.org](mailto:contactus@zanaafrica.org)  \n\n\n"
