Subsequently three revisions of the product have been made, moving from a 2.5w to 5w photovoltaic panel, and further improving the efficiency of the LED technology used. The light temperature which the LED produces has also been adjusted to produce a warmer light, with feedback from end users suggesting that it is more natural, and easier to read by. Product development continues with the addition of Azuri’s unique HomeSmart™ feature, which learns the customer’s power usage patterns over time and optimizes light brightness, battery charging, and load conditions to ensure the system delivers the best user experience depending on the available sunshine. HomeSmart™ is forecast to be available on future Azuri products.\n\nAzuri DUO is Lighting Global certified.\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/azuri-technologies-duo-solar-home-system#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: Yes  \nCountries where available: Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Ghana, Togo, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Sierra Leone, South Africa  \nPrice range: Contact supplier for quote  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: No  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/azuri-technologies-duo-solar-home-system#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 140 x 115 x 50 mm  \nWeight: 2.2 kg  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/azuri-technologies-duo-solar-home-system#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.azuri-technologies.com/)  \n[Solution page](http://www.azuri-technologies.com/what-we-do)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.azuri-technologies.com/info-hub/case-studies)  \n[5w DUO datasheet (pdf)](/ast/g3eakf0-2015-azuri-5w-duo-datasheet.pdf)  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/azuri-technologies-duo-solar-home-system#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Azuri Technologies\nurl: http://www.azuri-technologies.com/\n\n","_txt":"CEO – Simon Bransfield-Garth  \nAzuri Technologies   \nUnit D, Brookmount Court, Kirkwood Rd  \nCambridge  \nCB4 2QH  \nUnited Kingdom   \n+44 (0) 1424 464 801  \n[info@azuri-technologies.com](mailto:info@azuri-technologies.com)\n","name":"Azuri Technologies","url":"http://www.azuri-technologies.com/","_href":"/solutions/azuri-technologies-duo-solar-home-system#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/mafami-pty-ltd-vula-secure-medical-chat-and-referral ----\nid: g3c00xs\nname: Vula - secure medical chat & referral\ncategory: medical\ntags: Mobile Health\nimage: /ast/g3c00xs-sreenshot-1-in-app.png\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/QfRD3_ROv9s\ncreated: 2016-02-10 10:34\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"Solution Purpose:\nVula connects remote primary health care workers directly to on-call medical specialists using mobile technology.

It is a device that attaches to inexpensive, standard, mass-produced, window or “split-type” air conditioners, enabling it to cool a room down to 1 degree Celsius.\n\nCoolBot uses multiple sensors and a programmed micro-controller to convert a standard window air conditioner unit to a walk-in refrigerator cooler unit. It directs the air conditioner's compressor to operate at any desired temperature without freezing up. The interface linking the CoolBot controller to the air conditioner allows for 2-minute installations without any training, cutting, soldering or even taping.\n\n<!---Temperature control is the most important factor in reducing postharvest losses. In many developing countries, the rate of postharvest loss for fruits and vegetables often exceeds 30%. Cool storage can greatly reduce these losses, increasing income for farmers, wholesalers and distributors.\n\nTemperature control alone can extend shelf life by weeks or even months. Farmers, wholesalers and distributors who can store their produce and dairy longer can take advantage of better prices, a better product and more uniform income over time.\n\nReducing postharvest losses requires the use of postharvest technologies that can slow down deterioration and maintain the best possible product quality.\n\nDespite the critical need to maintain a cold chain in postharvest handling of perishable commodities, the high cost of conventional cold rooms is out of reach for a majority of smallholder farmers.

As a result, the farmers are forced to sell their product immediately after harvest. This exposes already vulnerable growers to exploitation by middlemen who take advantage of their inability to store the harvested product until prices rise.\n\nCoolBot was developed in 2006 by Ron Khosla, a farmer in need of a cooler. With conventional coolers costing at least $3,000, they were out of the question. Being a DIY kind of guy Ron started tinkering around with a standard window air conditioner. After further development and engineering, Khosla came up with a micro-controller with an intelligent algorithm which knows when to cycle the compressor off and on.\n\nCurrently, there are over 27,000 CoolBots in over 50 countries being used for vegetables, fruits, meat, dairy products and more.\n\n<!---CoolBot uses new patented technology and multiple sensors and a micro-controller \"brain\" that intelligently interfaces with an air conditioner - controlling and co-ordinating its output so that you can access nearly all your cooling power, even as you keep temperatures in your walk-in cooler (or any highly insulated room) in the 30's without re-wiring and without any freeze-ups.\n\nThe obvious solution was that we needed a brain. Through the combined efforts of a Timothy, college friend of Ron, and Ron, they were able to program an algorithm that knows when to cycle the heater off and on.--->\n\n","_href":"/solutions/store-it-cold-coolbot#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: Yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range: Over 200 USD  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: No  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/store-it-cold-coolbot#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 6.5 x 3.5 x 1.5 in  \nWeight: 9 oz.  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/store-it-cold-coolbot#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](https://storeitcold.com/)  \n[Product page](https://storeitcold.com/shop/)  \n[Documentation, article, or review 1](https://storeitcold.com/testimonials.html)   \n[Documentation, article, or review 2](http://storeitcold.com/news.html)   \n[installdiagram.jpg](/ast/e41sag8-installdiagram.jpg)  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/store-it-cold-coolbot#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Store It Cold, LLC\nurl: https://storeitcold.com/\n\n","_txt":"Katie Ifert-Miller  \nStore It Cold, LLC  \n1720 S.

Africa’s economy is stunted by opaque markets. Market opacity is driven by a large informal sector (90% of the continent’s GDP) and continued urbanization within the region. As young adults flock to cities for education and work, tribal networks and rural familiarity is lost, making competence and trustworthiness difficult to assess in undocumented, anonymous, highly-populated environments. This results in high transaction costs and friction associated with identifying qualified, reputable talent. Many skilled individuals are jobless and bad actors proceed unrecognized. This cycle erodes economic growth and societal trust.\n\nThe Ubuntu online marketplace (launched August, 2015) allows individuals and SMEs in urban Africa to document their economic activity, review one another on services provided, build their professional reputations, and market their businesses through consumer reviews. Using raw rating data from customers, Proficiency Scores are generated, which quantify a member’s strength at a particular skill. Likewise, Employer Scores quantify a member’s reputation as an employer. This visibility dramatically reduces transaction costs and risk stemming from uncertainty in an otherwise data-poor environment.\n\n\n","id":"do5ly5a","name":"Ubuntu Capital - Africa's online marketplace for services","image":"/ast/do5ly5a-ubuntu.png","category":"other","tags":"Financial Tools","created":"2015-12-11 10:19","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/ubuntu-capital-africa-s-online-marketplace-for-services","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Our current product is web-based.

It has been reinforced with glass fibers to prevent heat degradation and crushing. A black, powder-coated aluminum liner soaks up sunlight, converting it to heat energy for cooking. Its one-inch-thick layer of rigid foam, sandwiched between liner and base, is impervious to water, thanks to thousands of tiny, sealed air holes.\n\nA clear, double-layer insulated lid helps the oven retain heat while letting in maximum sunlight. Made from a durable vacuum-formed polymer, it features a snug-fitting lip (held fast by metal clips) and a layer of solar film to create the one-inch insulating air layer.\n\n\n\n\n","id":"785","name":"Solavore Sport Solar Cooker","category":"energy","tags":"Clean Cookstoves","image":"/ast/785-785-solar-opt.jpeg","video":"/ast/785-how-the-solavore-sport-works-sd.mp4","user_id":"1118","created":"2015-11-05 17:15","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/solavore-sport-solar-cooker","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":" \n\n","_href":"/solutions/solavore-sport-solar-cooker#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/solavore-sport-solar-cooker#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 692 x 311 x 431 mm  \nWeight: 4.1 kg  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/solavore-sport-solar-cooker#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.solavore.com)  \n[Product page](http://www.solavore.com/sport/)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/solavore-sport-solar-cooker#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Solavore \n\n","_txt":"Anne Patterson  \nSolavore   \nSt Paul  \n55104  \nUnited States  \n+1 860-705-0285  \n[anne.patterson@solavore.com](mailto:anne.patterson@solavore.com)  \n\n\n","name":"Solavore","_href":"/solutions/solavore-sport-solar-cooker#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/rorus-device-for-emergency-water ----\nid: 784\nname: Device for Emergency Water\ncategory: water\ntags: Water Purification\nimage: /ast/784-784-dew-2.0.jpg\nvideo: //player.vimeo.com/video/131227309#t=135scolor=70af25&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\nuser_id: 1178\ncreated: 2015-11-02 19:51\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"The Device for Emergency Water (DEW) is a personal, portable filter that provides one month of drinking water.

Clean hands. Wash hands with clean water and soap, once before delivery and once before cord cutting.\n2. Clean delivery surface. A plastic sheet for mothers to lie upon during delivery maintains a clean birth canal and perineum, and protects the newborn from potential sources of infection.\n3. Clean cord cut. A new razor blade in its original packing is sterile and can prevent the transmission of tetanus-causing spores and other pathogenic organisms via the umbilicus to the infant.\n4. Clean cord ties. Additionally, the use of clean thread or narrow tape to tightly tie the umbilicus helps keep the stump healthy.\n5. Clean cord stump care. Applying antiseptic such as chlorhexidine to the cord stump to prevent infection is the best care.\n\nWhere permitted by local regulations, PSI clean delivery kits may also include:\n\n- The antiseptic chlorhexidine for newborn skin washing and umbilical cord cleaning. Chlorhexidine has been shown to reduce newborn deaths by as much as 23 percent when applied within the first 24 hours of birth.\n- Misoprostol pills. A uterotonic drug which contracts the uterus, these pills can help to prevent excessive bleeding. Excessive bleeding after delivery, called postpartum hemorrhage, is the single biggest direct cause of maternal deaths – more than 220 women die of it every day. \n\nMisoprostol taken immediately after delivery significantly decreases a woman’s risk of postpartum hemorrhage and does not require refrigeration or injection, making it possible for a woman to take it after a home delivery without a trained attendant.\n\n","id":"700","name":"PSI Clean Delivery Kit","category":"medical","tags":"Women & Children","image":"/ast/700-700-faridah-2.jpg","user_id":"484","created":"2015-05-13 18:12","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/population-services-international-psi-clean-delivery-kit","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"PSI is a global health organization dedicated to improving the health of people in the developing world by focusing on serious challenges: a lack of family planning, HIV and AIDS, barriers to maternal health, and the greatest threats to children under five, including malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition. \n\nA hallmark of PSI is a commitment to the principle that health services and products are most effective when they are accompanied by robust communications and distribution efforts that help ensure wide acceptance and proper use. \n\nPSI works in partnership with local governments, ministries of health and local organizations to create health solutions that are built to last. \n\n","_href":"/solutions/population-services-international-psi-clean-delivery-kit#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/population-services-international-psi-clean-delivery-kit#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.psi.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.psi.org/program/clean-delivery-kits/)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/population-services-international-psi-clean-delivery-kit#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Population Services International (PSI)\n\n","_txt":"Population Services International (PSI)  \nWashington, DC  \n20036  \nUnited States  \n+1 (202) 785-0072  \n[info@psi.org](mailto:info@psi.org)  \n\n\n","name":"Population Services International (PSI)","_href":"/solutions/population-services-international-psi-clean-delivery-kit#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/maternova-full-obstetric-carry-on ----\nid: 699\nname: Maternova Full Obstetric Carry-On\ncategory: medical\ntags: Women & Children\nimage: /ast/699-horizontal-obstetric-kit-2.jpg\nuser_id: 484\ncreated: 2015-05-13 17:52\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"The Maternova Full Obstetric Carry-On is designed for use by community health workers, traveling midwives and nurses.

Sow six kernels of corn an inch deep and about ten inches apart in a circle of about two feet in diameter.\n - When the corn is about five inches tall, plant four bean seeds, evenly spaced, around each stalk.

In fact, any plot under 0.4 hectare (one acre) can benefit from these systems, but their modular design allows for expansion above that. They provide water savings of 30-70 percent, greatly reduce labor, and accurately deliver fertilizers. This makes cultivation during the dry season possible, with resulting yield increases of up to 30 percent.\n\nThere are three different models:\n\nMicrotube Drip Irrigation Systems\nNarrow micro-tubes bring water to the base of each plant from soft flat water lines. Inserting these micro-tubes into the water lines and ensuring that they remain unblocked takes effort. However, the system offers many advantages, including water savings of 30–70 percent as compared to traditional surface irrigation methods, improved yield and quality of crops, and reduced irrigation labor.\n\nButton Emitter Drip Irrigation Systems\nThe button emitters are an optional add-on to pre-punched drip irrigation tape, and when installed they direct a steady flow of water to the desired spot. Inserting these button emitters into the water lines and ensuring that they remain unblocked takes effort. However, the system offers many advantages, including water savings of 30–70 percent compared to surface irrigation methods, improved crop yield and quality, and reduced labor.\n\nBaffle Pre-Punched Drip Irrigation Systems\nThis product comes assembled with small plastic sleeves, or baffles, which localize water flow from pre-punched holes in the drip lines. Baffle pre-punched drip irrigation can provide water savings of 50–70 percent compared to surface irrigation methods, with improved crop yield and quality and reduced labor.\n\n\n","id":"619","name":"Drip Irrigation Systems","category":"agriculture","tags":"Irrigation","image":"/ast/619-mission-1.jpg","user_id":"922","created":"2015-02-24 17:36","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/ide-drip-irrigation-systems","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"iDE is an international non-profit dedicated to ending poverty in the developing world not through handouts, but by helping farm families access the tools and knowledge they need to increase their income. \n\niDE's origins as a formal organization lie in a visit to a Somalian refugee camp in 1982.

Irrigation would be limited to dense agriculture such as seedling nurseries.\n - The pumps require only a 40mm diameter well tube. (The rope pump requires a 75mm well tube, which adds significantly to the cost of a well.)\n - The pumps are designed so that the parts that wear can be easily replaced.\n - Suitable for multiple use / shared use for domestic applications.\n\n","id":"610","name":"Hand Piston Pump","category":"water","image":"/ast/610-download.jpeg","user_id":"922","created":"2015-02-20 16:46","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/ide-hand-piston-pump","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"iDE is an international non-profit dedicated to ending poverty in the developing world not through handouts, but by helping farm families access the tools and knowledge they need to increase their income. \n\niDE's origins as a formal organization lie in a visit to a Somalian refugee camp in 1982.

Pumping is activated by stepping up and down on treadles which drive pistons, creating cylinder suction that draws groundwater to the surface. Treadle pumps free farmers from dependence on rain-fed irrigation, provide capacity to raise crops in two growing seasons per-year, and help farmers maximize return on their small plots of land. \n\nThere are three different models of iDE Treadle Pumps available: \n\n-The Portable Treadle Pump: Portable models have an inlet pipe that can be extended to surface water or down a well, and can be used for watering up to 1,500 square meters, and its portability allows it to be used for multiple fields.  Treadles, handles and the frame are generally made of steel, but they can be made of local materials (wood or bamboo), as well. \n\n-The Fixed Treadle Pump: The Fixed Treadle Pump is a foot-operated, low-cost option for accessing large quantities of water when the depth to water is less than seven meters. Fixed models are mounted on a well casing and use the casing pipe as the pump support.  Treadles, handles and the frame are generally made of local materials (wood or bamboo). \n\n-The Pressure Treadle Pump: These pumps are especially versatile and can be used for a large variety of irrigating conditions. Most models have an inlet pipe that can be used to draw water from the surface or under ground. Available water output is inversely proportional to the height the pump is lifting the water: the deeper the water, and the higher or further the water is pushed, the less water output is available for the same energy expended. \n\nPump prices, including installation, range between US$20 and $100 based on country of purchase and type of pump.\n\n\n","id":"609","name":"Treadle Pump","category":["agriculture","water"],"tags":"Irrigation, Collection & Storage & Transport","image":"/ast/609-rangpur-tp.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/XmEw-sEoyaU","user_id":"922","created":"2015-02-20 15:55","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/ide-treadle-pump","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"iDE is an international non-profit dedicated to ending poverty in the developing world not through handouts, but by helping farm families access the tools and knowledge they need to increase their income.\n\niDE's origins as a formal organization lie in a visit to a Somalian refugee camp in 1982.

Fetching water in developing countries is very time-consuming, especially if much water is needed. Using conventional pumps, an average of 5 to 6 gallons per-minute can be pumped from shallow wells. The depth is also limited by the physical power a human can exert in lifting the column of water, which practically is around 230 feet.\n\nThe WaterBuck Pump is a powerful and efficient shallow and deep-well hand pump. The pump is designed to operate the same reciprocating lift pumps as those used in the windmill industry. The mechanics of this unique pump are unlike any conventional water well hand pump, enabling an operator to pump volumes of water from shallow wells with the same effort over conventional manual lift pumps. Practical amounts of water can now be pumped from much greater depths (700 feet is anticipated) under human power. Time spent pumping water needed for daily use can be greatly reduced.\n\nThe limits of the WaterBuck Pump are not yet known considering its newness and a wide variety of applications. However, in comparison to other powerful non-electric pumps with the same application, the WaterBuck exceeds the peak capacity of a 12-foot-diameter windmill by 60%.\n\nThe WaterBuck Pump is a water supply system for communities that have static water levels up to 200 feet with a capacity of up to 55 gallons per-minute. It can also pump uphill, supply water for furrow irrigation and pressurize tanks for drip irrigation or indoor plumbing. The pump can be adapted to accommodate a second lever and twin cylinders, allowing capacity to double with two to four operators pumping simultaneously.  A manual well pump of this caliber can be a great long-term asset for off-grid homesteaders and communities in developing countries. \n\n","id":"572","name":"WaterBuck Pump","category":["agriculture","water"],"tags":"Irrigation, Collection & Storage & Transport","image":"/ast/572-waterbuck-pump-with-pressure-tank-sm.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/3Rx5uuE2vao","user_id":"871","created":"2014-11-04 23:45","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/well-waterboy-products-waterbuck-pump","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Within the United States, an increasing number of individuals and communities are choosing to live off-grid for a variety of reasons of economics, privacy and self-sufficiency.

The yield is even greater with two operators. In another test, a 64-year-old woman pumped 7 gallons per-minute, also from the same application. \n\nThe WaterBuck Pump is currently manufactured and sold solely in the United States.

When fully fermented, this mixture creates a vegetative environment in which seedlings can be planted. The temperature in the desert greenhouse is usually between 15 and 25 degrees centigrade for most kinds of planted fruits and vegetables. The operational greenhouse in China shows positive results as eggplants, peppers, watermelons, tomatoes and other crops prosper.\n\nThe annual cost to maintain a greenhouse is around $3,200 USD. To construct a greenhouse in a typical desert surrounding requires about $7,150 USD. A desert green house investor can gain back their investment within two years.\n\n\n","id":"556","name":"The Desert Green House Project","category":["agriculture","partners"],"tags":["empowering-people","Methods & Learning"],"image":"/ast/556-desert-green-house.jpg","user_id":"811","created":"2014-09-25 22:15","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/desert-green-house-project-the","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The Desert Greenhouse method can help overcome challenges of desertification by converting desert waste land into productive agricultural land.

Liquid and solid waste are separated as they enter the container via the toilet bowl. Liquid waste drains to the bottom of the container while solid waste remains on the drying plate. The waste is exposed to continuous airflow that is driven through the unit by the forced aeration ventilation system. The movement of air is assisted by the ventilation extraction unit positioned on top of the outlet vent pipe. As the air moves through the system, it dehydrates the solid waste as it migrates down the sloped drying plate. The liquid that has drained to the bottom of the container evaporates. Sunlight absorbed by the black inspection cover increases the ambient temperature within the container.\n\nThe intense heat, prolonged retention periods and oxygen-rich air that is drawn in dehydrate and decompose the waste. At the end of this process the waste is converted via the stimulated bacterial and biological activity into an inoffensive, stabilized material which is reduced to roughly 5% of its original volume. The negative pressure within the container prevents the escape of any odor through the toilet bowl or the air inlet pipes.\n\nCurrently, there are four Enviro Loo models available with the same standard of materials and principles.

When an invading insect is detected, custom software is able to estimate the insect’s size and also to measure its wing beat frequency. Using this method, not only can the system distinguish between mosquitoes, butterflies, and bumblebees, but it can also determine whether a mosquito is male or female, as only female mosquitoes bite humans.\n\nOnce the software establishes that the insect is a valid target, it tracks the mosquito in flight, runs a safety check to ensure no innocent bystanders are in view, and then activates a laser to zap the mosquito.

Using the energy-efficient LED technology, it allows for an affordable system, which is also modular and expandable according to the consumer's needs. Starting typically with one system consisting of a small solar panel connected to a Ulitium lamp, the system can be expanded by adding more panels and lamps as required. The configuration can be as large as the user desires, spanning across the entire home. A Lithium battery pack is housed inside each Ulitium lamp, thus eliminating the need for a centralized controller and tedious maintenance. Because the energy consumption of the Ulitium is very low, it does not require large solar panels, making the Sundaya Ulitium range the best choice for solar DC lighting in the years to come.\n\n\nMain features:\n\n1) 240 Lumen light output (equal to 7W CFL bulb or 40W incandescent bulb).\n\n2) 23% efficiency (compared to 1% for incandescent and 5% for CFL).\n\n3) Built-in Energy Storage (60kJ) and management electronics (no need for separate battery and controller anymore). Solar panel plugs in directly to the lamp through a Hub (which provides lightning surge protections).\n\n4) Dimmable from 240 Lumen, down to 120 Lumen, 25 Lumen, and off position, by integrated pull-switch.\n\n5) Extremely low energy consumption:\n    a. 8kJ/h @ 240Lm\n    b. 4kJ/h @ 120Lm\n    c. 1kJ/h @ 25Lm\n\n6) Long battery life:\n    a. 7,500h @ 8kJ/h (240Lm), equal to 3.4 years @ 6h/day\n    b. 15,000h @ 4kJ/h (120Lm), equal to 6.8 years @ 6h/day\n7) Extremely long life of light-chips:\n    a. 20,000h @ 240Lm, equal to 9 years @ 6h/day\n    b. 40,000h @ 240Lm, equal to 18 years @ 6h/day\n\n8) Can be charged with very small solar panel of 50kJ/day (3Wp):\n    a. 240Lm > 50kJ / 8kJ/h = 6h of light per day\n    b. 120Lm > 50kJ / 4kJ/h = 12h of light per day\n\n9) System expandable from 1 lamp to 10 or 100 lamps, simply by adding and connecting more panels and lamps.\n\n10) System can be added by a Sundaya LCD Color TV with same built-in Energy Storage technology.\n\n11) Automatic regulation of energy between devices that are connected to same PV panel (or array of panels). Devices that are used most will get the most recharging energy the next day.\n\n12) Can charge from any 18-24VDC source or any 32-36 cell PV solar panel with maximum Open Circuit Voltage of 25VDC (max).\n\n\n","id":"455","name":"Sundaya Ulitium 200","category":"energy","tags":"Lighting","image":"/ast/455-ulitium.jpg","video":"//player.vimeo.com/video/16012736","user_id":"484","created":"2014-03-06 20:33","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/sundaya-nordic-ulitium-200","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The above is history for only one third of the world’s population living in the modern world.

In this way, residents can access the information repeatedly and when they need to apply it. When they are ill, pregnant, or cultivating land for a particular crop, information is readily available.\n\nAdditionally, the Talking Book enables teachers to reach more students in over-crowded classrooms. Teachers record readings of instructional materials like textbooks, stories, the alphabet onto a Talking Book. They also create interactive audio lessons such as multiple choice quizzes, audio hyperlinks, interactive games suited to the needs of their students.

It can be used over any open flame and de-contaminates the water as it passes through.\n\nThe Jompy Water Boiler is a lightweight and inexpensive fire top device which sits between cooking pots on an open flame. It enables households to cook a meal while at the same time heating water to temperatures high enough to kill 98% of waterborne bacteria, thereby making it safe to drink or use the water for cooking or bathing. Gravity pushes the water through the Jompy Water Boiler, which then delivers near boiling hot water within seconds and at a rate of one litre per minute. It works equally efficient on stoves or simple three stone fires, making it suitable for the use in both rural areas, as well as, urban dwellings. Through a more efficient use of the cooking fire, the Jompy Water Boiler also dramatically reduces fuel costs for poor families.\n\nFeatures and benefits:- Simple use and operation- Reduces in natural resources required- Reduction in time spent over a fire, reducing the effects of smoke inhalation- Cost-effective- Less time required looking for firewood- Can do two tasks at the same time – cook and heat water- Reduced smoke – reduced respiratory and eye problems- Flames from the fire are trapped under the device and pot, therefore less risk of clothes catching fire- Proven to kill bacteria- Reduces water-borne diseases like cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea- No maintenance, moving or replacement parts.\n\n","id":"395","name":"Jompy Water Boiler","category":["water","partners"],"tags":["empowering-people","Water Purification"],"image":"/ast/395-dia2.jpg","video":"//player.vimeo.com/video/15564523","user_id":"484","created":"2013-11-14 19:45","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/jompy-water-boiler","#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India, Kenya, Uganda   \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/jompy-water-boiler#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://jompy.co.uk)  \n[Product page](http://jompy.co.uk/about/)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/jompy-water-boiler#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Jompy\n\n","_txt":"Jompy  \nLondon  \nUnited Kingdom  \n44 (0)7762566638  \n[info@jompy.co.uk](mailto:info@jompy.co.uk)  \n","name":"Jompy","_href":"/solutions/jompy-water-boiler#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/technology-for-tomorrow-makapads-sanitary-pads ----\nid: 394\nname: MakaPads Sanitary Pads\ncategory: medical\ncategory: partners\ntags:     empowering-people\ntags:     100-under-100\ntags: Women & Children\nimage: /ast/394-maka3.gif.jpeg\nvideo: //player.vimeo.com/video/12830095?color=60bb48\nuser_id: 484\ncreated: 2013-11-14 19:31\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"MakaPads provide effective, low-cost protection to every girl and woman.\nMakaPads are made from papyrus and paper waste.

After setting up the water containers, the water slowly drips out of the containers through a tube, which can be attached to a water filter.

This makes the solar panel perpendicular to the sun all day as it moves from sunrise to sunset.\n\nAt the end of the day, when the sun is down, the water has completely dripped out of the containers and through the filter, creating clean water.

You kick-start the cooking process by heating your pot of food on the stove, then place it in the Wonderbag.\n\nWonderbag's insulating properties allow food that has been brought to the boil to finish cooking while in the bag. This greatly reduces the use of additional energy. This means families can cook hot meals while saving energy and money. It also means less time tending to the cooking food. Now time can be better spent looking after children, earning an income or doing essential chores.  The slowed cooking process, combined with sealing the pot in the Wonderbag, ensures the flavours and nutrients are retained inside the pot - not evaporated into thin air.\n\nBenefits:\n- Can reduce a family's fuel usage up to 30% - saving money and easing poverty\n- Reduces CO2 emissions\n- Reduces toxic fumes which means less respiratory problems and other diseases, particularly in children\n- Reduces accidents in the kitchen, because stoves are used less\n- Reduces time spent cooking, giving more time for child-care and other activities\n- Saves water: when the pot is insulated in a Wonderbag at a fairly constant temperature, less evaporation occurs, so less water is needed\n- Saves food: 20% of all staple food in Africa is burned, due to pots being placed on open fires and unregulated stove tops.

The solar panels are installed on the QBotix designed trackers without individual motors and are optimized for cost, strength, durability and installation simplicity. The robots travel on a track and adjust each tracker periodically to optimally face the sun.  This design aims to optimize for material usage, reliability and ease of installation.\n\nEach robot replaces hundreds of individual motors and controllers found on conventional tracking systems. In addition, the back-up robot provides built in system redundancy. This improves the system reliability and ensures high availability of tracking capability.\n\nKey Features:\n- Costs as little as existing single axis systems but generates up to 15 percent more energy. QTS will generate up to 40 percent more energy than fixed mount systems.\n- Compatible with all standard solar modules, inverters and foundation types used in ground-mounted installations for commercial, distributed generation and utility deployments.\n- Ships pre-assembled and can be installed without using heavy equipment.

Spinal injuries – even leading to death - are common among people carrying up to 40 lbs. on water on their heads every day.  Most women use dirty buckets or jerry cans that previously held pesticides, fuel or other chemicals.\n\nPackH2O is an alternative to buckets and jerry cans to carry water home and help keep it clean. The water backpack can help keep water clean as it’s carried and stored because it can be hung up even when full.  PackH2O starts out clean and has a removable liner that, after use, is easily sanitized with exposure to sunlight. The PackH2O relieves the physical stress of carrying water by distributing the burden evenly on the wearer’s back.  The PackH2O is easy to carry, shifting and distributing the weight to the wearer’s back – a healthier solution.\n\nThe PackH2O is 7 times lighter and 7 times smaller than a jerry can that holds the same amount of water. That means the PackH2O is less expensive to ship and requires less room to store than rigid containers – a key consideration in emergency relief and shipping to remote water-stressed regions.\n\nFeatures include:- Double Liner- Chlorine tablet pouch- Adjustable shoulder straps- Protective Cover- Volume: 5 gallons- Strap strength: 352 lb- Puncture resistance w/poly liner: 52 lbf- Drain Spout- Hand straps- Puncture-resistant shell- Reflective tape- Weight: 43 lbf- Backpack seam strength: 13.8 lbf- Tear resistance of backpack fabric: 63 lbf\n\n\n\n","id":"312","name":"PackH2O","category":["water","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","Collection & Storage & Transport"],"image":"/ast/312-pack-images-scaled.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/M6-K2yYAJg0","user_id":"484","created":"2013-04-26 14:22","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/greif-packh2o","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Each pack is $10 USD.

The foil tank is placed in the ground and used to collect/capture up to 50 cubic meters of rainwater. From there the water is pumped up, purified when needed and distributed as drinking water to the consumers. Collected water can be stored for a period of up to 8 months dependant on level of maintenance.\n\nThe RainCap system is easy to transport, install and maintain. It can be installed in combination with the UV WaterBox. The tank can be cleaned regularly and removed when needed. The RainCAP system has a lifetime of ten years or more.\n\nTarget group and delivery:\nThe RainCAP is designed for usage in tropical countries with modest to high rainfall. Sizes are family level (with a 15 m3 tank) and village level (a 50 m3 tank). The tanks follow a modular design and can be linked dependent on the needs of the client. The 15 m3 tank serves an extended family of 30 people for 8 months consuming 2 liters per person per day. The 50 m3 tank serves a village of 200 people drinking 2 liters per person per day for 4 month.\n\nRainwater Catchment area:\nCapturing of rainwater is best done using existing roof systems. Schools, medical centers and governmental buildings can be often deployed for that purpose. By installing rainwater gutters along the roofs the water is collected. The RainCAP system is attached at that point to take care of the filtering, storage and purification of the water. The total of the collected rainfall is dependent on the condition of the roofs, the gutters and the level op maintenance in combination with the local rainfall pattern.\n\nLimitations:\nThe RainCAP system is best applied in tropical regions displaying moderate to high rainfall. The systems can be installed in relative soft ground (compacted sand, silts, etc.). It is advised to avoid sharp rocks surfaces in order to prevent puncturing of the foil material.\n\n","id":"305","name":"RainCAP System","category":"water","tags":"Collection & Storage & Transport","image":"/ast/305-raincap-concept-brochure-03.jpg","user_id":"484","created":"2013-04-11 19:54","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system","#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 15 or 50 cubic meter tanks available  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.orangewaterfoundation.nl)  \n[Product page](http://www.aaws.nl/index.php/products/rain-water-harvesting)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.aaws.nl/images/stories/bestanden_aaws/brochure_rainCAP_mail.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Aqua-Aero WaterSystems BV\n\n","_txt":"Aqua-Aero WaterSystems BV  \nCG Delft  \n2611  \nNetherlands  \n31 15 212 96 13  \n[info@aaws.nl](mailto:info@aaws.nl)  \n\n\n","name":"Aqua-Aero WaterSystems BV","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/datawind-ubislate7ci-tablet ----\nid: 304\nname: UbiSlate7Ci Tablet\ncategory: education\ncategory: partners\ntags: 100-under-100\ntags: Connectivity, Devices\nimage: /ast/304-ubislate7ci.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/ECiFSfIXae8\nuser_id: 527\ncreated: 2013-04-09 17:23\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"The UbiSlate7Ci is a low-cost 7\" multi-touch capacitive screen Android tablet.

All Lazarian building designs have a 20-25 R-Value and an Economic Life of 40-50 years. The wall systems of the homes comprise Lazarian polystyrene (EPS) foam blocks, concrete and steel rebar, a sustainable solution to cost effective, energy efficient housing for the needy. When the economic life of the Lazarian home is complete, approximately 90% of the home may be recycled, including the Lazarian EPS foam blocks, concrete, rebar, metal roofing, and wood. In places where use of wood is not available or desirable, roof truss systems may be built with recyclable steel angle iron or aluminum. Lazarian World Homes are simple and inexpensive to build. With minimum training, families are able to build their own homes. On-site Instruction is provided by Lazarian staff. Because the walls of a completed Lazarian home have cells filled with concrete and steel reinforcing bar, the resulting structure inside the walls of a Lazarian building is commonly referred to as Reinforced Concrete Post and Beam Construction. This is one of the strongest methods of construction known to structural engineers. Lazarian homes will withstand major earthquakes, storms and natural disasters.

Esoko's focus is on agricultural value chains with the explicit goal of improving the transparency of markets and the operational efficiency of organizations. The founders believe mobile phones provide an unprecedented and disruptive opportunity to change how markets work for both businesses and consumers.\n\nOn one hand, Esoko collects and provides content such as prices, bids and offers, weather, and agricultural tips to which users can subscribe. On the other, Esoko provides a powerful set of tools so that organizations can manage their own information and content: not only pushing out alerts and advisories to the field, but also tracking information from the field (like activities, compliance, profiles).\n\nSmallholder farmers can sign up to Esoko to receive a package of weekly advisory services. This typically consists of current market prices, matching bids and offers, weather forecasts, and news and tips.\nNot only can farmers negotiate better prices, choose different markets, or time sales better, but they may also participate in outgrower schemes through Esoko profiling and reputational history. The goal is simply to put more money into the hands of smallholder farmers, and try to address the information asymmetry that exists where farmers are frequently disadvantaged price-takers, often selling at a loss. After receiving better information, income improvements for farmers are estimated to be between 10-30%. Sometimes individual sales to new markets can increase by 100%. Esoko is not trying to remove the important role that traders must continue to play, but believes a more transparent system will reduce the overall time to market for goods, improve margins for all, and create an ecosystem of facilitation and brokering.\n\n\n","id":"284","name":"Esoko","category":["agriculture","education"],"tags":"Methods & Learning, Connectivity, Mobile & Desktop Applications - Agri","image":"/ast/284-esoko-logo.png","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/YJ2GMkyjLSk","user_id":"501","created":"2013-03-07 22:06","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/esoko","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Based in Mauritius and Ghana, Esoko is a private business, focused on changing the way markets work through innovative mobile solutions.

Once installed, it becomes a compact, affordable and sturdy shop offering energy, products, tools and services.\n\nEvery kiosk is designed as a kit of parts, only to be assembled upon arrival at its target location. The packages are light-weight, do not require a container and are thus easily transportable to remote, off-road areas – in extreme cases, on the back of donkeys.\n\nWhile certain parts of the kiosk (particularly the electrical components) will be manufactured centrally to ensure quality and durability, all others can be made of local materials such as bamboo, wood, adobe, stone, metal or even recycled goods. The kiosk will be assembled locally with local materials; it becomes accepted as a domestic product.\n\nAfter assembly, despite its light weight, the kiosk is safe and secure – an essential quality in communities where even the smallest products are of comparably high value. The entire structure is firmly anchored in the ground. Special detailing of all joints and assembly points on the inside of the building shell makes tinkering with the kiosk from the outside difficult.\n\nEvery SOLARKIOSK will provide enough power for solar lighting, mobile phone and car battery charging, a computer and even a solar fridge. Depending on local conditions, internet, TV and music can be offered as well. Since the SOLARKIOSK will most likely house the only fridge in the area, it can cool drinks and medication. In addition to those energy services, customers can buy solar lanterns, mobile phones, top-up cards for them and any other product that one typically finds in such kiosks.\n\n","id":"272","name":"SOLARKIOSK","category":["energy","partners"],"tags":["empowering-people","Lighting"],"image":"/ast/272-screen-shot-2012-12-15-at-1.19.03-pm.png","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/uxsWCa2PtcA","user_id":"354","created":"2012-12-15 18:19","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/solarkiosk","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Africa, pilot program and local distribution underway in Ethiopia\n\n","_href":"/solutions/solarkiosk#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Africa, potential extension to other countries  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nAvailable online: yes  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Potentially  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Africa  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/solarkiosk#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: full-size kiosk  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/solarkiosk#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.solarkiosk.eu)  \n[Product page](http://www.solarkiosk.eu)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/solarkiosk#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: SOLARKIOSK GmbH\n\n","_txt":"Ulrich Moller  \nSOLARKIOSK GmbH  \nBerlin  \n10179  \nGermany  \n+49 (30) 9155 3155  \n[ welcome@solarkiosk.eu](mailto: welcome@solarkiosk.eu)  \n","name":"SOLARKIOSK GmbH","_href":"/solutions/solarkiosk#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/solarear-hearing-aid ----\nid: 271\nname: SolarEar Hearing Aid\ncategory: medical\ncategory: partners\ntags: 100-under-100\ntags: Medical & Surgical, Medical Devices\nimage: /ast/271-hearingaid.png\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/fzz669hSARw\nuser_id: 306\ncreated: 2012-12-15 18:05\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"From: www.solarear.com.br\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 6000 million people are hearing impaired, This is because of lack of prevention and treatment of diseases as well as higher noise pollution in several employment sectors.

With 1.5 billion people living off-the-grid at the base of the pyramid, we knew that we needed to find a scalable solution. So we started the design process with need finding. We traveled across East Africa and Central Asia where we became inspired by the creative and innovative ways people accessed electricity but – at the same time – distraught by how unreliable and expensive these homegrown solutions were.\n\nWe saw a huge need that wasn’t being well-served. About 600 million people use cell phones even though they don’t have access to energy and even more people depend on burning kerosene for lighting, which can be dirty, dangerous and expensive. So we wanted to design a high quality battery that would charge mobile phones, lights and other devices, and would be powered by renewable energy, be sophisticated enough to meet people’s energy needs, be durable enough to withstand the environment, yet be simple and sleek in its design so everyone could use it.\n\nThat’s why we created the ReadySet. We’re delivering this renewable energy system because we want to enable people to access the global economy through mobile technology, and to have clean, safe and affordable light. Inspired by how “mobile banking” revolutionized financial independence, we believe that “mobile energy” is the next exciting frontier.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/fenix-intl-readyset-solar-kit#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: USA, Rwanda, Uganda  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nAvailable online: yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Contact Fenix for details  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/fenix-intl-readyset-solar-kit#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://fenixintl.com/)  \n[Product page](http://fenixintl.com/products/readyset-solar-kit/)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/fenix-intl-readyset-solar-kit#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Fenix Intl\n\n","_txt":"Fenix Intl  \nSan Francisco  \n94107  \nUSA  \n[Contact](http://fenixintl.com/contact/)  \n\n\n","name":"Fenix Intl","_href":"/solutions/fenix-intl-readyset-solar-kit#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/design-revolution-jaipur-knee-remotion ----\nid: 268\nname: Jaipur Knee - ReMotion\ncategory: medical\ncategory: partners\ntags:     empowering-people\ntags: Medical & Surgical\nimage: /ast/268-knee.png\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/56IyU8xjB9c\nuser_id: 306\ncreated: 2012-12-15 17:40\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"Globally, approximately 10 million above-knee amputees live in developing countries and need assistive devices to regain mobility and return to work.

Called the “Mafuta Mali” (meaning “oil wealth” in Kiswahili), it was based on an original “ram press” design by Carl Bielenberg but was designed to be more efficient, durable and profitable to use. KickStart also developed and designed the first Gravity Bucket Filter to go with the press and developed a complete set of tooling for local mass production of both the press and filter.

PAYG allows Angaza to sell high-quality alternative energy products, like the SoLite, for a low, affordable upfront price. Customers then pay the remainder of the unit price in small increments over time by pre-paying for their energy use. To do this, they simply send Angaza a micropayment of the size of their choice using a phone-based mobile money service, such as Safaricom M-PESA.  Angaza receives the payment and initiates a call to the customer’s phone. They answer that call and hold their phone near the SoLite.  Angaza uses the open audio channel to securely communicate the customer’s payment to their product. By using audio communication to leverage the customer’s existing phone hardware, Angaza can embed its technology in solar products at minimal additional cost. The Angaza PAYG hardware then tracks how much energy the customer consumes, and after the pre-paid energy is used, output shuts off until the next payment is made. Payments are rent-to-own, and the SoLite unlocks permanently when the full price has been reached.

Students must demonstrate English proficiency in order to apply, but introductory English language courses are offered to qualified applicants who do not meet this requirement. Applicants are required to submit an one-time application of $10-$50, based on the student’s native country and economic background. Administrative fees to cover exam processing are covered by a $100 fee per each course. Applicants in need may apply for scholarships.\n\nIn line with other online education platforms, UoPeople operates on a limited budget, employs collaborative and open-source e-learning tools, and hosts online study communities where students share resources and discuss weekly topics. However, UoPeople is distinct in that it offers specific degrees to a selected class. The inaugural class, which began courses in 2009, consisted of 177 students from 49 countries. A community of educators comprised of active and retired professors, librarians, master-level students and other professionals participate in the educational activity and oversee the assessment process of this tuition-free online education model. Former presidents of New York University, the University of Oxford, and the Indian Institute of Technology sit on UoPeople’s President’s Council, a team that works closely with UoPeople’s founder to bring together decades of experience and advance the mission of UoPeople.

From that the Mandarin Ultra was born: a quality solar light that would effectively meet a family's lighting needs, but that was also at a price that was affordable to them.\n\nSince then and with the help of our excellent distribution partners, the Mandarin Ultra's distribution reach has grown quickly across Africa and now into Asia. We have now distributed several hundred thousand lights across over 20 countries.\n\nWhile meeting lighting needs with renewable energy is a key part of reducing energy poverty, we are also developing new products such as renewable energy powered radios, cell phone chargers and more.

This occurs primarily in developing countries, often in areas that don’t have access to innovations in modern medicine. One of the biggest problems these babies face is hypothermia: they are not able to regulate their own body temperature, and therefore cannot stay warm. In fact, room temperature for these small infants feels freezing cold. 4 million babies die within their first month of life. Those that do survive often develop life-long health problems such as early onset of diabetes, heart disease, and low IQ.\n\nTraditional incubators cost up to $20,000. Many of these babies could be saved with an incubator, but traditional incubators are expensive and not available, nor appropriate, for rural areas that don’t have access to electricity. “Many premature babies are never given a chance to make it out of the hospital,\"\" says Crystal, a missionary in Uganda, “Because there are no incubators, the babies are left to die. They are put on a table or directly in the trash without the comforting touch of their mothers in those final moments.” In light of these constraints, current solutions are in-home remedies. Desperate methods create to take care of these vulnerable babies include wrapping hot water bottles around their bodies or placing them near ovens. These solutions are unsafe and cause many infants to die unnecessarily. If given simple and proper medical treatment, many would not only survive, but grow and thrive.\n\nEmbrace donates our low-cost Infant Warmer to populations in need through establishing partnerships with like-minded NGOs who are serving our target communities. Emergency Embrace, our humanitarian assistance program, supplies Infant Warmers to organizations working in areas facing dire situations on a short-term basis. Embrace is currently working in India and in emergency settings globally on a case by case basis. We aim to expand our programs by creating partnerships with local NGOs to distribute infant warmers around the world.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/embrace-infant-warmer#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/embrace-infant-warmer#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://embraceglobal.org/)  \n[Product page](http://embraceglobal.org/main/product)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://embraceglobal.org/main/news)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/embrace-infant-warmer#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Embrace\n\n","_txt":"Embrace  \nSan Francisco, CA  \n94117  \nUnited States  \n+1 (415) 663-6202  \n[comments@embraceglobal.org](mailto:comments@embraceglobal.org)  \n","name":"Embrace","_href":"/solutions/embrace-infant-warmer#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/ecobuild-nigeria-ecobeam-building-technology ----\nid: 228\nname: Ecobeam Building Technology\ncategory: housing\ntags: Housing & Shelter\nimage: /ast/228-ecobeam-in-action-1.jpg\nvideo: //player.vimeo.com/video/4704423?color=ffffff\nuser_id: 405\ncreated: 2012-04-06 21:00\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"The  Ecobeam building technology is  a versatile and  eco-friendly timber frame building system that involves the  construction  of structures using Ecobeams as well as Ecobags (sandbags).

The Prime Radio is the next generation of power independent, multi-band radio to provide 24/7 listening access - anytime, anywhere.\n\nAn analogue radio with FM, AM and three SW bands, the Prime features an attractive digital LCD screen, enabling accurate tuning for even hard to find stations. Station frequencies are displayed in a large, clear, easy-to-read format. A color-coded user interface, with only three buttons and one knob, makes it easy to understand for children and adults alike.\n\nThe Prime features a suite of power options – a solar panel, a hand crank, and a DC input which can be plugged into either a wall socket or a car battery. The solar panel, which slides onto the back of the radio, can charge the Prime directly through a cable, or removed and charged wirelessly. The wireless solar panel, an upgraded option, has a powerful, rechargeable battery pack, which provides additional battery capacity and extends playtime.\n\nThe upgraded solar panel also includes a USB output socket, enabling mobile phone charging on demand. There is an additional cost for this, but it will pay for itself in no time by charging phones. Given the lack of electricity in rural areas, charging mobile phones can be a challenge. This solar panel model comes with a USB lead and two standard charging port tips. Mobile charging by USB leads will become more common as phone manufacturers are now standardizing tips.\n\nWhen charging the Prime with the hand-crank in either direction, a green indicator light shines to let the user know that they are winding at optimum speed. If you wind it too slowly, now you’ll know to speed up.\n\nThe Prime’s powerful speaker makes it ideal for group listening in classrooms, marketplaces, or in community meetings. Radio distance education classes in countries like Malawi, Southern Sudan and Zambia can have more than 100 learners gathered around one radio. To cater for this, there is an auxiliary speaker output socket, allowing for additional speakers to be plugged in, boosting listening volume.\n\nThe Prime has an integrated LED light that is pushed to activate. It provides a bright light at night, or in unlit classrooms that can aid in reading or help teachers to grade papers.\n\n","id":"224","name":"Prime Radio","category":["education","energy","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","Connectivity, Energy Generation, Devices"],"image":"/ast/224-primeradio.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/qV8VQ05eo2c","user_id":"393","created":"2012-04-02 21:34","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/lifeline-energy-prime-radio","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Some of the team that brought you the Lifeline radio also designed and developed the Prime, under the direction of our new product development and trading arm, Lifeline Technologies Trading Ltd.

In emergencies untrained persons are often performing IV administration and may give an incorrect dose due to the design of these valves. This improved valve adjusts flow volume linearly based on the position of a wheel. It is similar to existing designs but the groove the tube sits on is curved, which means the wheel compresses the tube gradually as it is spun up the track on the valve.This makes it easier to use and allows a scale to be printed on the valve body showing what the flow rate is at any given position.

The biochar application is useful as a means of carbon sequestration and mitigating global warming issues too.\n\nThe value of charcoal was known to Indians and utilized as part of traditional and cultural practices for various purposes. The charcoal was never considered as a waste material. The crop residue burnt in the fields gets converted into charcoal and ash. In the process, the earth (soil) also gets burnt. This practice benefited the soils and farmers since ages (here no comparison with composting the biomass). The slash and burn in the margins of the forests or inside the forests is a very well known practice all over India (although it is no more sustainable because of huge population demands and costing the sustainability of forests). The charcoal, a byproduct of the traditional stoves is added to the farm yard manure / compost, which gets inoculated with the soil microbes, which was later transferred to the fields. The waste from the potters kiln a combination of charcoal, pottery shards and little ash was always a valuable source for improving the fertility of the soils. Although the addition of charcoal to the soils was existing as a practice, but it was not explicit, it remained as part of traditional best practices in India. As we explore more and more evidences are visible and proves that the Indian farmers were using charcoal since hundreds of years.

They are still being used to generate over $3.9 million in new profits and wages every year and they proved the potential of micro-irrigation in East Africa. However, this pump can only pull water from a well or pond and dump it into an irrigation furrow – it cannot push the water thru a hosepipe or up a hill. It soon became clear that Kenyan farmers preferred to irrigate with a hosepipe or sprinklers and wanted to pump water up to their fields on the sides of hills. So in October 1998 KickStart introduced the new Super-MoneyMaker Pump and this new suction and pressure pump superseded the original and the Original MoneyMaker was taken off the market in February 1999.\n\nThe Super MoneyMaker Pressure Pump was launched in October 1998, in response to a demand by farmers for a pump that can push water uphill as well as simply pulling it up from the source. This means it is suitable for use on steeply sloping land where the water source may be at the bottom. Thousands use it to pump water from hand-dug wells, rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. It is ideal for sprinkler irrigation, filling overhead water tanks, or for use with nozzles and sprays attached to the end of the delivery hose. This powerful pump can draw water up from 23 feet (7m) and has a total pumping head of 46 feet (14m).

Through no fault of their own and often with no warning, families lose their homes, their possessions and their livelihoods. Every day they are faced with a battle for survival and our mission is to help them.\n\nWe provide emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies for families around the world who are affected by disasters at the time when they need it the most. Our Founder, Tom Henderson OBE, saw the humanitarian response in most disasters was in the form of food and medicine. Little or no assistance was being given in terms of safe, secure shelter to help families survive the first days, weeks and months as they try to rebuild their lives. ShelterBox was created to fill this void. \n\nSince our inception in 2000, we have responded to earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, landslides, typhoons and conflict, delivering emergency humanitarian aid to families in need on every continent.\n\nThe ShelterBox solution in disaster response is as simple as it is effective. We deliver the essentials a family needs to survive in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Each large, green ShelterBox is tailored to a disaster but typically contains a disaster relief tent for an extended family, blankets, water storage and purification equipment, cooking utensils, a stove, a basic tool kit, a children’s activity pack and other vital items.\n\nWe rely on public donations and could not operate without the generosity of people the world over. Our supporters constantly go the extra mile to help make a difference to the lives of families who survive disasters. We have had fundraisers climb Mount Kilimanjaro, row the Atlantic, cross India in a Tuk Tuk and even cycle 10,000 miles on a tandem. Every box we send out bears its own unique number so our donors can see where the box they have sponsored has gone. \n\n","_href":"/solutions/shelterbox#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/shelterbox#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.shelterbox.org/)  \n[Product page](http://www.shelterbox.org/about.php?page=9)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.shelterbox.org/news.php)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/shelterbox#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: ShelterBox\n\n","_txt":"ShelterBox  \nHelston, Cornwall  \nTR13 0LW  \nUnited Kingdom  \n44(0)1326 569782  \n[info@shelterbox.org](mailto:info@shelterbox.org)  \n\n\n","name":"ShelterBox","_href":"/solutions/shelterbox#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/medentech-aquatabs-water-purification-tablets ----\nid: 174\nname: Aquatabs Water Purification Tablets\ncategory: water\ntags: Water Purification\nimage: /ast/174-aquatabs.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/K75YxPE7YAQ\nuser_id: 365\ncreated: 2011-10-18 03:39\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"Aquatabs are tablets used to rapidly disinfect large or small quantities of drinking water.

While many of the highly potent drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS and TB are toxic to the liver, deaths due to drug-induced liver failure are very rare in countries like the United States, where a patient’s liver function is monitored regularly. Yet this is not the case in resource-poor countries, where roughly 20% of TB patients and 25% of HIV/AIDS patients, lacking access to diagnostic tools, succumb to liver complications related to their treatment.\n\nDesigned specifically for use in the developing world, DFA’s device will enable semi-quantitative determination of two key liver enzymes, AST (aspartate transaminase) and ALT (alanine transaminase), which are routinely used to measure liver toxicity amongst patients receiving antiretroviral medications. As the liver becomes damaged by potent medications, these two enzymes, usually found in the liver, are released into the blood stream. From a single drop of whole blood, this test will determine whether blood levels of these two enzymes are baseline/normal, greater than two-times baseline/normal, or greater than five-times baseline/normal. The 2x and 5x thresholds, which indicate that treatments should be “monitored closely” or “altered immediately”, correspond to protocols established by the U.S. FDA to guide treatment during clinical trials.\n\nThe liver function test is targeted to cost $0.10 or less, will be about the size of a postage stamp, and will function without external power or equipment. The output will be a straightforward, semi-quantitative colorimetric indication of enzyme levels and will be easily integrated into telemedicine networks.\n\n","id":"172","name":"Liver Function Test","category":"medical","tags":"Medical & Surgical, Medical Devices","image":"/ast/172-capture.png","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/BX-1AMSm6KU","user_id":"360","created":"2011-10-16 05:12","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/diagnostics-for-all-liver-function-test","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Paper is significantly less expensive than other materials typically used in diagnostic devices and is compatible with a variety of existing diagnostic tests. It inherently wicks biological samples through channels patterned in the paper to assay zones, and its mesh-like properties filter the sample of contaminants such as dust and dirt.\n\nDFA’s devices can be brought directly to those who are unable to travel to hospitals or clinics and, with no mechanical parts, are robust enough for use even under severe environmental conditions. No auxiliary equipment, electricity, or laboratory facility is needed to use the device or process a sample. Results are quickly displayed, enabling immediate clinical decisions.\n\nMinimal training is required to use a DFA device. It is both user-friendly and minimally invasive. A sample from a finger prick is sufficient to yield results. No syringes are involved and neither clean water nor sample preparation is needed. Results are displayed in an easily understood manner, as through a colorimetric scale.\n\nBefore distribution, devices are packaged so that they are protected from the environment and provide adequate shelf life for transport and storage in the developing world. While DFA devices are single-use, they can be easily and safely disposed of through incineration, assuring that they do not contribute to the global medical waste problem.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/diagnostics-for-all-liver-function-test#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/diagnostics-for-all-liver-function-test#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.dfa.org)  \n[Product page](http://dfa.org/our-technology/)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/diagnostics-for-all-liver-function-test#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Diagnostics For All\nurl: http://www.dfa.org\n\n","_txt":"Una Ryan  \nDiagnostics For All  \nCambridge  \n 02139  \nUSA  \n617.494.0700  \n[info@dfa.org](mailto:info@dfa.org)  \n","name":"Diagnostics For All","url":"http://www.dfa.org","_href":"/solutions/diagnostics-for-all-liver-function-test#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/zana-africa-sanitary-pads-for ----\nid: 171\nname: Sanitary Pads For Africa\ncategory: medical\ntags: Women & Children\nimage: /ast/171-img-2962-621x241.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/brLg5J0kPCY\nuser_id: 360\ncreated: 2011-10-16 04:59\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"Globally, 150 million children currently enrolled in school may drop out before completing primary school - at least 100 million of these are girls. Kenyan adolescent girls miss approximately 3.5 million learning days per month due to lack of funds to purchase sanitary pads. This impedes their ability to compete in the classroom, leads to low self-esteem, higher drop-out rates and, in many areas of Kenya, makes them vulnerable to early marriage. \n\nZanaA has found a long-term and holistic solution to this problem, which is to establish a sustainable business creating locally-produced, environmentally-safe sanitary pads in Kenya while advocating for greater policy support of girls. \n\nFirst, ZanaA plans to coordinate, on-line, the national distribution of sanitary pads, to ensure all vendors are distributing proper sanitary pads and with synchronized training in sanitary pad use and disposal as well as age-appropriate sexual maturation education.\n\nThis will help reduce the logistical burden of sanitary pad distribution, ensure sexual predators are not given entry to the school, distribute pads at the convenience of the school curriculum, enable equitable distribution across the country, and reduce the cost burden to donors. Along with this comes the development of a tool kit for enhancing policy around girls and education.\n\nSecond, ZanaA has become the exclusive distributor to the informal market (including school girls) for a sanitary pad invented by Dr. Musaazi of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, called MakaPads™, made from local, easily replenishable natural resources.\n\nMakaPads has been approved by the Ugandan Bureau of Standards, is in the final stage of registering with the Kenyan Bureau of Standards, and is pending international patent. This is the first of several solutions, to provide sanitary pad production opportunities using available natural resources.\n\nThird, ZanaA is interesting in networking with any producers of sanitary pads and any organizations who provide or who are planning to provide sanitary pads to schools because the world can handle many solutions for different contexts.

Each year, nearly 80 million women experience unintended pregnancies, about half of these end in abortion. Hundreds of millions of women annually suffer disability from pregnancy complications, and more than 500,000 die as a result of pregnancy, childbirth, or unsafe abortion. Almost all these deaths are preventable. Women also represent more than 50 percent of people living with AIDS; and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), excluding HIV/AIDS, are the second most important cause of loss of health in women, especially young women. Women want and need more female-initiated methods that can protect against pregnancy and STIs. Diaphragms could help meet this need, but some characteristics of traditional diaphragms limit their use and acceptability.\n\nPATH responded to the call for simple-to-use, female barrier protection by developing the SILCS Diaphragm, a single-size, reusable device with a contoured rim that allows the SILCS Diaphragm to fit most women with improved comfort. Design and development of the SILCS Diaphragm began in 1994, and user-centered evaluations of over 200 prototype designs refined performance and features. The single-size design will simplify the logistics of supply and provision. PATH used stakeholder assessments to ensure that comfort, ease of handling, and acceptability were built into the product. As a result, the SILCS Diaphragm directly addresses user and programmatic needs which will lead to improved access and acceptability. Acceptability studies among naïve users in South Africa and  Thailand found that women were able to learn to use the device easily and that women and men found the SILCS Diaphragm acceptable during use. In a comparative crossover study of the SILCS Diaphragm with a traditional diaphragm in the Dominican Republic, 19 of 20 women reported preferring the SILCS Diaphragm device after short-term use. Eventually, the single-size device could be provided over the counter or outside the clinic-based system where regulatory authority and clinical practice allow.\n\n","id":"148","name":"SILCS Diaphragm","category":"medical","tags":"Women & Children","image":"/ast/148-unit-silcs-land.jpg","user_id":"328","created":"2011-04-14 20:52","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/path-silcs-diaphragm","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The SILCS Diaphragm design was patented by PATH in 1998; a second patent on a spring modi cation has been  led.

The World Health Organization/Expanded Programme on Immunization (WHO/EPI) called for the design of such devices in 1987.\n\nIn response to WHO’s call, PATH designed one of the first feasible approaches to nonreusable syringes for immunizations: an autodisable (AD) syringe with a fixed needle that automatically locks a\bfter a single injection. When the syringe is filled to the preset 0.5-ml level, the plunger stops and cannot be pulled back further. A\bfter the vaccine is injected, the plunger automatically locks so that the syringe and needle cannot be reused. Known as the SoloShot syringe, this technology was licensed to and is now manufactured and marketed by BD, one of the world’s leading syringe manufacturers. Third-party field validations of the device in Pakistan in the early 1990s demonstrated the acceptability and usability of the design. PATH also has assisted several other manufacturers of AD syringes to ensure a wide variety of products are available and to facilitate the lower pricing that accompanies increased competition and production volume.\n\n","id":"141","name":"SoloShot","category":"medical","tags":"Vaccination","image":"/ast/141-uniject-400pix.jpg","user_id":"328","created":"2011-02-26 07:55","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/path-soloshot","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Since commercial introduction in 1992, 5.4 billion immunizations have been delivered using SoloShot syringes by public health programs in more than 40 countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. United Nations Children’s Fund—which has already distributed hundreds of millions of AD syringes to EPI programs—now provides only AD syringes to countries requesting disposable syringes, many of which are SoloShot syringes. BD has renewed its five-year licensing agreement from PATH, which allows it to supply SoloShot syringes to national and international public health agencies at low cost. The price of AD syringes is dropping rapidly and is currently within two cents of the price of disposable syringes. PATH is also assisting USAID-supported family planning agencies with the introduction of a 1-ml AD syringe to be bundled with injectable contraceptives.\n\nAD syringes are now routinely used in immunization programs throughout the world. They can be used safely by vaccinators regardless of past experience or training. The devices are quicker to use than a conventional syringe and are preferred over a conventional syringe by vaccinators due to the speed and ease with which a correct vaccine dose can be drawn.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/path-soloshot#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/path-soloshot#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 3/8” (10 mm) to 1½” (38 mm) needle length  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/path-soloshot#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.bd.com/pharmaceuticals/)  \n[Product page](http://www.bd.com/pharmaceuticals/products/auto-disable.asp)  \n[ts-update-soloshot.pdf](/ast/141-ts-update-soloshot.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/path-soloshot#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: PATH\n\n","_txt":"PATH  \nSeattle, WA  \n98109  \nUSA  \n2062853500  \n[info@path.org](mailto:info@path.org)  \n\n\n","name":"PATH","_href":"/solutions/path-soloshot#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/path-intradermal-adapter ----\nid: 140\nname: Intradermal Adapter\ncategory: medical\ntags: Vaccination\nimage: /ast/140-id-adapter.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/CT6IA72mTZA\nuser_id: 328\ncreated: 2011-02-26 07:35\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"Rabies vaccine is expensive and often in short supply—approximately 20,000 people die of rabies each year in India, often because they were unable to access treatment. For rabies vaccine, the same or better protection can be achieved by delivering smaller amounts of vaccine intradermally (into the top layer of the skin), sparing valuable doses and stretching supplies to provide for more patients. Intradermal (ID) regimens for rabies vaccine have been adopted in many regions, protecting people who have been exposed to rabid animals, while saving costs and vaccine.\n\nThis approach is not yet universal, despite clear benefits, due in part to the difficulty of giving an ID injection correctly. The Mantoux technique, which uses a traditional needle and syringe for ID delivery, has historically been recognized as a difficult and inconsistently used technique. In many countries, only certain health care workers are able to perform ID injections, such as for rabies vaccine and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin or BCG, a vaccine given intradermally at birth to prevent tuberculosis. Smaller ID doses of other vaccines could also be effective. Such dose sparing could be particularly meaningful to immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries, as they could potentially reduce the amount of vaccine needed per patient, thereby cutting costs and overcoming vaccine shortages. However, concerns regarding the difficulty and a lack of reliability of conventional ID injections limit research in this field and introduction of this technique into immunization programs. \n\nThe intradermal adapter makes ID injections easier. It facilitates the procedure by standardizing injection depth and angle. It is anticipated that the ID adapter would expand the pool of health care workers capable of performing the procedure. This would have a particularly high impact in remote or underserved communities with more limited access to health care specialists.\n\n","id":"140","name":"Intradermal Adapter","category":"medical","tags":"Vaccination","image":"/ast/140-id-adapter.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/CT6IA72mTZA","user_id":"328","created":"2011-02-26 07:35","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/path-intradermal-adapter","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"In partnership with SID Technologies of Newtown, Pennsylvania, PATH developed the ID adapter from the initial concept through manufacturing of clinic-ready devices.

Babies who don’t weigh enough at birth are terribly vulnerable. Their bodies are not strong, and they may have a difficult time breathing, eating, gaining weight, and fighting infection. Babies who weigh less than 2.5 kg at birth are approximately 20 times more likely to die than heavier infants.\n\nMany babies in the developing world are delivered at home, by traditional birth attendants or midwives who may lack the training and tools to recognize low birth weight. PATH’s BIRTHweigh scale helps low-literate health workers identify low-birthweight children immediately. Once identified, these infants can be given care, such as immediate breastfeeding and warming, or referred for higher levels of medical care. The BIRTHweigh scale compensates for low levels of literacy by supplying pictorial instructions for use. It depends on a simple indicator for low birth weight and is easy to use; little training is required, allowing health workers in the developing world to detect low birth weight in infants before complications arise.\n\nTo use the BIRTHweigh scale, health workers place the baby in a secure sling that is suspended by a hook on the scale. Instead of the common digital or dial readouts that report an infant’s exact weight, the first version of the scale had a window that shows yellow if the baby’s weight is too low and blue if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kg, the desired weight for a healthy newborn.\n\nDuring tests in Indonesia—where 250,000 Indonesian infants die each year from preventable illnesses—we found that during night deliveries, in huts with little or no lighting, birth attendants were unable see the color change. PATH took the recommendations of the midwives and field testers and modified the scale to include a tactile indicator on the top of the handle. The indicator button sinks into the grip if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kilograms, and birth attendants can feel whether babies are at a healthy weight, even in the dark.\n\n","id":"139","name":"BIRTHweigh","category":"medical","tags":"Women & Children","image":"/ast/139-birthweigh-scale.jpg","user_id":"328","created":"2011-02-26 07:28","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Most recently, in response to new technologies that may allow newborns to be treated successfully in the home, PATH designed a new version of the scale, one that can identify three different weight categories.

This version of the scale gives health workers a reliable tool for gauging how much medication to give a sick child. It empowers more workers to administer the drug and reduces the risk that the wrong dose will be given.\n\nPrototypes of PATH’s latest version of the BIRTHweigh scale, which is in a stage of active development, were successfully field-tested for accuracy and acceptability in Nepal and India in 2004. The scale is designed for local production and distribution, to reduce costs and stimulate economic development in the countries where the scale is used. One of the earlier versions of the scale is already in use in many countries and for sale through UNICEF under the name “BebeWey.” We are currently seeking a manufacturer to whom we can transfer the technology for the latest version, so that it will be readily available to community health workers who care for infants suffering from severe infection.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: no  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.path.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.path.org/publications/detail.php?i=1016)  \n[ts-update-bw3.pdf](/ast/139-ts-update-bw3.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: PATH\n\n","_txt":"Patricia Coffey  \nPATH  \nSeattle, WA  \n98109  \nUSA  \n2062853500  \n[pcoffey@path.org](mailto:pcoffey@path.org)  \n\n\n","name":"PATH","_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/path-jet-injector ----\nid: 138\nname: Jet Injector\ncategory: medical\ntags: Vaccination, Medical Devices\nimage: /ast/138-unit-jet-injector3.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/8lZ4pbNzUP0\nuser_id: 328\ncreated: 2011-02-26 07:01\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"Injections without needles?

The need for a needle-free technology remained.\n\nThe problem was that older injectors administered multiple doses of vaccine from a single vial. New injectors use disposable syringes—each containing a single dose of vaccine—that prevent the transmission of infection from one person to the next.\n\nPATH has worked with several jet injector companies over the years to advance “second-generation” jet injectors. Designed for use in developing-country clinics or large immunization campaigns, these jet injectors are hand-wound or spring-powered, generating a high pressure stream so that the vaccine penetrates the skin. Going forward, we will collaborate with several companies to further evaluate designs and conduct clinical testing. At the same time, we’re compiling evidence that demonstrates the jet injector will be cost-effective and practical in the developing-country context—and for the long term.

At some point during the trip, my Aunt told me that her daughter (my cousin) was having trouble with \"unit conversion\" which was not allowing her to be placed in the more advanced math track for 7th grade. Nadia was clearly a very bright girl, so I made a deal with her. I'd remotely tutor her for an hour after work as long as she was willing to do any extra work I gave her.\n\nI began remotely tutoring Nadia in August of 2004. She was in New Orleans--where I also grew up-- so we used a telephone to talk and Yahoo Doodle as a shared notepad. Nadia ended up catching up and getting ahead of her class so I started tutoring her brothers, Arman and Ali, as well. Eventually, word got around and I was remotely tutoring and handful of cousins and family friends. Scheduling around my work, their soccer practice, and the different time zones became a little ridiculous, so I started to make YouTube videos for them to watch in their own time, at their own pace.\n\nIt didn't take long to see that other students (including adult learners) were hungry for videos like these so I kept going!\n\nEven before I made the videos, I started writing simple Javascript problem generators so that my cousins would never run out of practice problems. I wanted to know when and how they were doing the problems, so I added a database to track usage. 70 modules and 10,000 lines of code later (much of which has made the software adaptive), it has morphed into the adaptive assessment exercises on our site.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/khan-academy#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Free  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/khan-academy#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Product page](http://www.khanacademy.org/)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/khan-academy#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Khan Academy\n\n","_txt":"Salman Khan  \nKhan Academy  \nMountain View, CA  \n94042  \n[info@khanacademy.org](mailto:info@khanacademy.org)  \n","name":"Khan Academy","_href":"/solutions/khan-academy#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/neok12-com ----\nid: 128\nname: neoK12.com\ncategory: education\ntags: Teacher & Student Resources\nimage: /ast/128-videoplaying-480x400.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/HRvxlMARB-g\nuser_id: 304\ncreated: 2011-01-08 19:23\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"At NeoK12, we believe that kids learn best when they 'see' how things work, when, where and why they happen.

The projector represents an innovative combination of cutting-edge hardware, \"abandoned\" technology and the creative re-purposing of existing products.\n\nThe Kinkajou light source is a five-watt white LED, a rugged, high-efficiency alternative to the fragile, expensive incandescent bulbs used in most commercial projectors. The LED is rated to last 100,000 hours, or the equivalent of eleven years of continuous operation. As an alternative to expensive glass lenses, the Kinkajou optics assembly cleverly incorporates seven plastic lenses adapted from existing \"View-Master\" toys. The resulting projection system can cast an image up to three meters wide from microfilm onto practically any flat surface--big enough for an entire classroom to read.\n\nBy combining microfilm with LEDs, DtM has found a novel application for what was considered an obsolete technology. Microfilm is durable and cheap. A microfilm reel of 10,000 pages--enough to accommodate an entire reference library--costs just US$6.

The system also employs low-cost plastic optics adapted from Fisher-Price toys and state-of-the-art LED lighting to project an image large enough for the entire classroom to read.

This product offers reverse current protection. The SolarRoll is designed to operate in a temperture range of -22°F to +122°F (-30°C to +50°C)\n\nThe SolarRoll consists of photovoltaic cells and will produce power when any of these segments are exposed to sunlight. This means that you can partially unroll the panel and still utilize the power provided. Each segment produces an average of 50mA. To calculate the amount of power your panel will produce when partially unrolled, count the number of segments that you have rolled out and then multiply by 50mA. The voltage stays the same when rolled out entirely or partially.\n\nFully extended, the SolarRolls produce 900mA, 600mA, or 300mA, depending on wich SolarRoll you own. They can also be linked to other SolarRolls of the same wattage to double the current output. Due to the amount of current present, we recommend that no more than three panels be put in a series at one time. \n\nThe SolarRoll is waterproof and can be submerged all the way up to the electrical connectors and not be damaged.

Since then, the evolution of this concept has flourished. Backed by glowing reviews in every major magazine and newspaper in this country and others, the SolarRoll has officially taken its place as one of our most talked about products. The proof, though, is in the remarkable performance. The waterproof SolarRoll has given sea kayakers the power to photograph their voyages from the far reaches of the planet. And next spring, it will assist Ed Viesturs in his final summit, Annapurna, as he polishes off the last peak of Endeavor 8000.

Each solar panel comes with three meters of cable such that they can be mounted in the most effective locations possible.

While on sabbatical in Nepal, Dave visited local villages and was struck by the poor conditions of the people. Most of them were relying on kerosene lamps which produced little light and filled the homes with dangerous smoke. As the annual income of the Nepalese villagers averaged $200 USD, Dr. Irvine-Halliday realized that there was a great need for simple, safe, healthy, affordable and rugged lighting.\n\nDave had been working with LEDs for more than two decades, and spent most of 1997 and 1998 trying to make an acceptable white light from various combinations of colored indicator LEDs. He made white light but it was simply not bright enough to be of any practical use in the developing world. Nichia, a Japanese company, had invented a bright White LED a few years earlier and Dave immediately requested samples. The 'eureka' moment occurred when Dave lit his first White Light Emitting Diode. \n\nIn 1999, Dr. Irvine-Halliday and his wife, Jenny, tested their prototype WLED lamps in a number of Nepali villages and the response from the villagers was so absolutely positive that they knew what they'd be doing with the rest of their lives.  In 2000, they returned to Kathmandu and with the assistance of their Nepali friend, Muni Raj Upadhyaya, lit the first four villages in the world with WLED lighting, thus laying the pioneering origins for the development of LUTW into a global lighting initiative.\n\nTogether with Ken Robertson, Roy Moore and Pauline Cummings, Light Up The World was  established as a legal entity in 2002. From a singular idea born among the poor, LUTW has grown into a global humanitarian organization reaching out to even the remotest areas of the world.\n\nThrough generous support from interested individuals, corporations, host country organizations, international foundations and industrial partners, LUTW has brought light to more than 25,000 homes in 51 different countries throughout the developing world from Afghanistan to Zambia. Over 300,000 people have been impacted directly by this new and innovative approach to development.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/light-up-the-world-five-watt-home-lighting-system#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nAvailable online: yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Contact manufacturer  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/light-up-the-world-five-watt-home-lighting-system#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.lutw.org/)  \n[Product page](http://lutw.org/how-we-work/technology/)  \n[model-i-technical-information-100208.pdf](/ast/85-model-i-technical-information-100208.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/light-up-the-world-five-watt-home-lighting-system#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Light Up the World\n\n","_txt":"Light Up the World  \nCalgary, AB  \nT2R 0K2  \nCanada  \n403-266-5004   \n[lutw@lutw.org](mailto:lutw@lutw.org)  \n\n\n","name":"Light Up the World","_href":"/solutions/light-up-the-world-five-watt-home-lighting-system#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/ampair-energy-limited-100-wind-turbine ----\nid: 84\nname: Ampair 100 Wind Turbine\ncategory: energy\ntags: Energy Generation\nimage: /ast/84-ampair-100.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/pFT0sacMeKE\nuser_id: 304\ncreated: 2010-07-19 20:56\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"The Ampair 100 Wind Turbine is a microwind turbine for charging battery systems in harsh conditions.

Several years later the Aquair hybrid wind and water turbines were introduced, followed soon after by the Aquair UW micro hydro generator (now just called the Underwater). The business was initially started in 1972 in Guildford and soon moved down to Poole in Dorset.\n\nIn 2000 the Ampair business was taken over by Doughty Engineering Ltd and production moved from Poole to Ringwood. In late 2005 ownership transferred to Boost Energy Systems Ltd at which point production moved to Warfield in Berkshire. Boost have been active in manufacturing distributed power systems in the UK since 1957, concentrating on the 1kW to 50kW market.\n\nThis was a friendly acquisition and we have been able to relocate most of the staff to the main manufacturing premises in Berkshire, or make arrangements for them to continue on an outsourced basis. Most of the supply base has been unaffected and indeed Doughty continue to act as one of the Ampair foundries. AmpairR and AquairR remain the main brand names of Ampair, and are joined by PowerFurlTM.\n\nAt Ampair we believe that sustainable societies can only be built with integrated mixed economies based upon a variety of energy sources with a long term future. For this reason we continue to invest in our UK manufacturing operations and are actively seeking to develop our renewable and distributed energy business.\n\nIn 2010 Ampair Energy Limited purchased the business and assets of Boost Energy Systems Limited. At the same time the venture capital group Sigma Capital Group plc has committed £1.5m to the business.

In addition to wall recharging ability, you can power it yourself using the trusted Freeplay self-charge technology, so you'll never run out of power.  That, combined with the reliability of ultra-bright white LEDs rated for 100,000 hours, makes the Indigo Lantern the most dependable lantern on the market.  With the peace of mind of never needing to ever replace batteries or bulbs, you'll know that your Indigo Lantern will work whenever you need it, anytime, anywhere.  Yet you'll have excellent brightness and shine time.\n\nIdeal for everyday and emergency use, indoors and out, the Indigo Lantern puts the power in your hands.  The self-charge system offers maximum dependability for those times when you can’t afford to be left in the dark by dead batteries.  A quick wind (about 60 seconds) provides up to 1 hour of light using the directional light – and you can wind again at any time for as much shine-time as you want.  An LED charge level indicator tells you the optimal winding speed.\n\nUsing the dimmer switch, the Indigo allows you to adjust the brightness of the lantern to your specific requirements, from maximum brightness to a night-light.  This also allows you to maximize your shine time:  the lower the brightness, the longer the shine.\n\nThe included reading light / flashlight is also an LED with excellent performance, delivering an hour of brilliant white light per 60-second wind.\n\nThe Indigo Lantern is rechargeable and, when fully charged, the lantern provides up to 8 hours of continuous ultra bright light, and 100 hours of night-light, using the LED cluster.  Similarly the directional light will shine for up to 40 hours continuously.\n\nThe rechargeable battery means that there is no use of disposable batteries that are harmful to the environment.  Not even for \"spare power\":  you are the spare power.\n\nInternal mechanical components are specified to industrial standards for repeated use and long life.  A handle swings up to let you to carry or hang the lantern as required, and the sturdy rubber feet allow for placement on uneven surfaces.\n\nWith the Freeplay Indigo Lantern, you’ve got light anytime, anywhere.\n\n","id":"81","name":"Freeplay Indigo LED Lantern","category":"energy","tags":"Lighting","image":"/ast/81-fp-ml1.png","video":"//player.vimeo.com/video/40666570","user_id":"304","created":"2010-07-19 16:58","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/freeplay-energy-indigo-led-lantern","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"It was whilst watching a BBC documentary in April 1994 when Chris Staines first realized the potential of an innovative idea from British inventor, Trevor Baylis. \"The Clockwork Radio\", as the device was first known, was proposed as a means of halting the spread of Aids in Africa through better education.

It can boil about 1.5 liters of water in less than eight minutes.  It is like cooking on a stove powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), except that the fuel comes free: It uses rice husks, a farm waste common in agricultural countries like the Philippines. Unlike earlier devices this stove converts the husks into gas to emit a cleaner flame which helps the environment. “It will help minimize the problem of rice husk disposal which contributes a lot to environmental pollution,\" says the inventor.\n\nThe stove has the following advantages as compared to other commercially available stoves:\n\n1. It uses no cost rice husk fuel, which means cost savings to users\n\n2. It is convenient to operate since the start-up of fuel can be done by using pieces of paper, and gas is ignited using a match stick\n\n3. Almost no smoke can be observed during cooking. 4. It can cook rice and two viands per cooking, which is\ngood enough for a family of 4 to 6 members\n\n5. The degree of burning the fuel can be controlled using a rotary switch. Hence, the amount of flame on the burner can be regulated\n\n6. Gasified rice husks can be converted into char which is a good material as soil conditioner due to its high water holding capacity, or ash, when the burning of char is prolonged inside the reactor, which is a good refractory material\n\n7. It is also adoptable for battery, in case of brown out, by using an appropriate-sized inverter\n\n8. It is safe to operate with no danger of explosion since the stove operates at a normal atmospheric pressure.\n\nSome of the limitations of the stove are:\n\n1. It is difficult to use in areas where rice husks are not available. It cannot be used for other biomass material since the design was made for rice husks.\n\n2. It needs hauling of fuel when the source of rice husks is from a distance. In cities or urban areas, there is a need for a separate enterprise to ensure the supply of this fuel.\n\n3. Loading of fuel and unloading of burned rice husks are quite inconvenient. This is most especially true to households that are used to operating LPG stoves.\n\n4. It needs electricity to run the fan which limits its adoption in areas that are far from grid, except when a 12-volt battery and an appropriate inverter are available.\n\n\n","id":"68","name":"Rice Husk Stove - Agni Star Biomass Gas Stove","category":"energy","tags":"Clean Cookstoves","image":"/ast/68-rice-husk-gasifier.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/h5umoDIAXLY","user_id":"299","created":"2010-05-03 11:21","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/other-rice-husk-stove-agni-star-biomass-gas","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The stove, now in its third generation, comes in multiple sizes.

A treadle pump can be used by all members of a farming family to irrigate crops. The user stands on two treadles, usually made of bamboo, and pedals them. This light exercise, similar to using a step machine, operates two metal pump-cylinders which are connected to a tube-well, or to a surface level pond. The tube-well consists of robust, flexible plastic, sunk into the ground until it reaches an aquifer. Before first use, water is poured into the cylinders to ‘prime’ the pump. When the user pedals, water is lifted up onto the field, or into a pond or irrigation canal. The pedalling action is easily mastered and not strenuous, so that anyone in the family can take a turn at irrigating the fields. Typically the household will operate a pump for between two and eight hours per day, often in the early morning or evening when the weather is cool.\n\nDirect impacts of Treadle Pump irrigation\n\n - The income impact of the Treadle Pump technology varies across households and regions, but US$400 per year is the estimate of the average increase in the annual net income of each household\n\n- It frees the farmer from the limitations of rain fed farming and raises his capacity to grow crops in both winter and summer\n\n - Land augmenting : For the poor farmers constrained by the small size of the landholdings, treadle pump technology acts as a land augmenting intervention. With the use of Treadle Pump the farmers can cultivate all the year round thus increasing their cropping intensity to 200-300%.\n\n - Easy and productive : The Treadle pump is easier to use and is more productive than a variety of traditional manual irrigation devices. Its output is in the range of 4000-4500 litres/hour with a lift of 4-7 m.\n\n- Change in cropping pattern : Treadle Pump technology enables the farmers to grow crops they were not able to grow earlier, example- farmers are able to grow vegetables and make more money by selling them\n\n- The most significant impact is the increase in the crop yield\n\n- Among the most important reason cited by farmers themselves is the leaching away of the fertilizers due to the strong water currents generated by the diesel pumps (traditionally used by farmers for irrigation during non-monsoon seasons)\n\n - Farming families have a better diet with more vegetables and milk, and plenty of surplus produce to sell\n\n- Acumen Fund survey showed that helping with pumping did not add to chores of children or prevent them attending school\n\n- TUV Nord has verified greenhouse gas savings from avoided diesel as 0.477 tonnes/year CO2 per pump.\n\n\n","id":"67","name":"KB Treadle Pump","category":["agriculture","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","Irrigation"],"image":"/ast/67-ide-india-treadle-pump.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/D1d32uVHZtc","user_id":"118","created":"2010-02-09 11:36","template":"solution","featured":"1","_href":"/solutions/international-development-enterprises-india-idei-kb-treadle-pump","#summary":{"_hdr":"---- #summary ----\n\n","_txt":"IDEI has designed an irrigation solution that is both easy to use and versatile.

The Appliance weighs only 21 pounds / 9.5 kg and has a life span of more than 20 years.\n\nGLOBAL SUN OVENS® are designed to be as energy efficient as possible, maximising energy to achieve the highest possible temperature and retain highest amount of heat possible, while minimizing weight and negative impacts on the environment. The annual wood consumption for cooking throughout developing countries is 1,000 pounds of wood per person. A family of six using a GLOBAL SUN OVEN® for 80% of their cooking needs would save 4,800 pounds of wood per year, and prevent over 88 tons of CO2 emissions tbeing released into the earth's atmosphere, over the oven's 20 year lifespan. \n\nOther than cleaning, no other ongoing maintenance is required.\n\nDue to their durability, ability to be used when there is less sun and the fact that food can be cooked faster, means the GLOBAL SUN OVEN® are less expensive on a cost per meal basis than other solar cooking devices. The high quality materials that are required to make a GLOBAL SUN OVEN® make its initial cost higher but its overall cost lower than any other solar cooking device.

Field experience and clinical test results have shown this filter to effectively eliminate approximately 99.88% of most water born disease agents.\n\nThe filter design used by PFP was developed by Dr. Fernando Mazariegos of the Central American Industrial Research Institute (ICAITI) in Guatemala, in 1981. The goal was to make bacterially contaminated water safe for the poorest of the poor by developing a low cost filter which could be fabricated at the community level.\n\nIn 1994 AFA or Family Foundation of the Americas, a Guatemalan organization, became interested in the ceramic water filter when it was found that other strategies were not yielding effective results. Chlorine tablets in rural communities were not well accepted; health complications associated with chlorine misuse caused additional concern. Boiled water often wasn’t effective when households failed to boil water long enough to purify it. AFA carried out a one year follow-up study on the initial Mazariegos-led filter project, concluding that including this filter into rural health education efforts reduced the incidence of diarrhea in participating households by as much as 50 percent.\n\nIn October 1998, Hurricane Mitch tore through Central America. It was one of the most destructive hurricanes ever recorded, affecting millions of people. Safe water was urgently needed as supply systems (already of borderline capacity and efficiency) had been badly damaged. This prompted Potters for Peace to begin a Ceramic Water Filter production workshop in Nicaragua using the Mazariegos design.\nIn the first six months over 5000 filters were distributed through non-governmental organizations. The workshop, called Filtron, evolved into a worker-owned cooperative and is now incorporated as a privately owned business.\n\nPotters for Peace has since provided consultation and training to set up production facilities around the world: Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Ghana, El Salvador, the Darfur region of Sudan, Kenya, Benin, Yemen, Nigeria, Tanzania, Peru, Somaliland and others.\n\nThe CWP has been cited by the United Nations’ Appropriate Technology Handbook, and tens of thousands of filters have been distributed worldwide by organizations such as International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF, Plan International, Project Concern International, Oxfam and USAID.\n\nWe have financed or assisted in laboratory testing and field studies of the filter with various institutions, among them: MIT, Tulane University, University of Colorado and University of North Carolina.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice (USD): 15-25  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 11\" wide x 10\" deep  \nWeight: 15kg  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.pottersforpeace.org/ )  \n[Product page](http://pfp.he207.vps.webenabled.net/?page_id=63)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Potters for Peace\n\n","_txt":"Kaira  Wagoner  \nPotters for Peace  \nGreensboro, NC  \n27407  \nUSA  \n520-249-8093  \n[pottersforpeace@gmail.com](mailto:pottersforpeace@gmail.com)  \n","name":"Potters for Peace","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier ----\nid: 47\nname: Reverse Osmosis Water Purifier\ncategory: water\ntags: Water Purification\nimage: /ast/47-rotech1.gif\nuser_id: 118\ncreated: 2010-01-29 18:38\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"Reverse Osmosis (RO), also known as hyper-filtration, is a purification process used in desalination plants to eliminate concentrated solutions like dissolved minerals and salts in water.  RO can be customised to address arsenic, nitrate, sulphate and other chemical contamination.\n\nRO technology uses a membrane that is semi-permeable, which allows only pure water to pass through it. During the process it rejects large contaminants passing through the membrane. Quality RO systems use a process known as ‘crossflow’ which allows the membrane to continually clean itself. RO requires a driving force to push the fluid through the membrane and as some of the fluid passes through, the rest continues downstream, thereby sweeping the rejected contaminants away from the membrane.\n\nThe unit that is skid-mounted and designed for indoor installation comprises a raw water pump that supplies water to the micron cartridge water filtration system and to the high pressure pump. Micron cartridge filters control the silt density before water enters into the membrane whereas high pressure pump exists to boost water pressure as required.\n\nAdvantages:- RO technology has a proven record to reduce/treat contamination related to fluoride/salinity and other chemicals.- It eliminates water from suspended solids, major inorganic pollutants like acids, salts, toxic metals and most of the organic micro pollutants including aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides and toxins.- The model has a throughput of 200 litres to 2,000 litres per hour and ensures quality safe drinking water for a village size of 2,000 to 10,000 population (the capacity can further go up).- Incurs low maintenance costs.- Easy to operate and maintain.\n\n\n\n","id":"47","name":"Reverse Osmosis Water Purifier","category":"water","tags":"Water Purification","image":"/ast/47-rotech1.gif","user_id":"118","created":"2010-01-29 18:38","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Tata Projects partnered with the Naandi Foundation,  a non profit organisation in India, to install RO technology in several villages in India providing clean drinking water to 400,000 villagers.\n\nMore information about this project can be found on the Naandi Foundation website:\nhttp://www.naandi.org/provide_drinking_water/makewatermore_2b.aspx\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: India  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.tataprojects.com)  \n[Product page](http://www.naandi.org/provide_drinking_water/ReverseOsmosis.aspx)  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.creativ-entrepreneur.com/?page_id=1858&lang=en)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Tata Projects\n\n","_txt":"Dipankar Chatterjee  \nTata Projects  \nSECUNDERABAD  \n500003  \nIndia  \n+91 40 66 23 88 01  \n[dipankarc@tataprojects.com](mailto:dipankarc@tataprojects.com)  \n\n\n","name":"Tata Projects","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/p-and-g-children-s-safe-drinking-water-pur-purification-sachets ----\nid: 45\nname: PUR Water Purification Sachets\ncategory: water\ncategory: partners\ntags: 100-under-100\ntags: Water Purification\nimage: /ast/45-pursachets.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/aPR92qJ9ABk\nuser_id: 118\ncreated: 2010-01-25 16:11\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"PUR is a powdered mixture that removes pathogenic microorganisms and suspended matter, rendering previously contaminated water safe to drink.

Experience in Nicaragua has shown that a lifetime in excess of 2000 hours is possible.\n\n","id":"42","name":"Low-cost pump set","category":"agriculture","tags":"Irrigation","image":"/ast/42-practica-pump-set.jpg","user_id":"118","created":"2010-01-01 00:00","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/practica-foundation-low-cost-pump-set","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The pump is imported from China at low cost.

The pump is made from stock steel which is protected with a 3-part paint system, and is also fitted with stainless steel nuts and bolts which makes the ROVAI a very durable low-cost pump. \n\nThe standard RP6 model comes with 8 meter of piping and a cement cover. This makes it ideal for improving and protecting open hand dug wells. All pumps come with an operation and maintenance manual (Khmer language) which contains numerous step by step line drawings making it easy to follow.

Water is poured into the top of the unit and is filtered as it passes through the sand. The raw water is biologically improved partially through predation in the biological or 'schmutzdecke' layer as well as the sand providing a natural mechanical barrier. \n\nThe mould unit is an all steel construction manufactured to a high quality and finish. The main parts of the mould unit are shown in the exploded view below, these are: 1) the puller, 2) an inner mould, and 3) outer mould. The mould is simply bolted together, turned upside down and fitted with a copper outlet pipe. A concrete mix is then poured in the mould and compacted down. After several hours the puller is used to remove the inner mould after which the outer mould can be removed revealing the finished filter shell. The filter is then filled with sand and gravel layers. \n\nContaminated water is poured into the unit at the top. The water passes through the diffuser plate and the sand and gravel layers. Head pressure pushes water through the copper pipe in the base to the outlet point. Biological contamination is reduced through the actions of adsorption; mechanical filtering, predation (‘biological layer’) and natural die off. The actual round concrete BSF units produced are approximately 915mm high with an outer and inner diameter of 355mm and 295mm respectively. The filter depth is approximately 450mm with a surface area of around 0.07m2.

To improve this IaW were keen to follow the experience of Medair and their round BSF because of the advantages that this type of unit offered. Typical cost for square filters moulds made by local workshops and other NGO’s have been around $350. To reduce the cost of the roundB SF mould we are  urrently working on utilizing and making modifications to existing moulds used for producing cement pipes (for storm drainage). These basic moulds cost around $85 for the standard mould and are widely available throughout the country and the skills and production facilities for making these are well established. These standard pipe moulds can be modified to allow the base to be sealed off and to add the additional nose cone as standard. The cost of final modified mould is estimated to be around $150 which is less than 50% of the square filter moulds. The amount of concrete used in the round filter is around 20% less as well which provides significant savings on materials costs as well.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Cambodia  \nPrice range (USD): 100 to 200 USD  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 915mm height  x 355mm outer diameter / flow rate 0.6ltr/minute  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[Website](http://www.ideas-at-work.org)  \n[Product page](http://www.ideas-at-work.org/IdeasBioSandFilter.html)  \n[round-bio-sand-filter.pdf](/ast/38-round-bio-sand-filter.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Ideas at Work\n\n","_txt":"Ideas at Work  \nPhnom Penh  \nCambodia  \n+855 24 399 577  \n[info@ideas-at-work.org](mailto:info@ideas-at-work.org)  \n\n\n","name":"Ideas at Work","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/gujarat-energy-development-agency-solar-voltaic-pump ----\nid: 34\nname: Solar Voltaic Pump\ncategory: water\ntags: Collection & Storage & Transport\nimage: /ast/34-solar-pvpump.jpg\nuser_id: 118\ncreated: 2010-01-01 00:00\ntemplate: solution\n\n","_txt":"The solar water pumping system is a stand-alone system operating on power generated using solar PV (photovoltaic) system.
