A fan blows oxygen into the ACE 1 chamber through holes at both the bottom and the top. This drives the fire to increase in temperature until it reaches approximately 1000°C. These conditions cause the biomass to gasify. Then the hot gas floats up to the top, meeting more oxygen and combusting completely. \n\nThe stove will produce as much as 5kW worth of energy. When fully charged, the battery will power the fan for over 20 hours of cooking. The battery can also be used to charge a mobile device or run LED lighting, and can be boosted using a solar panel.\n\nIn 2018 we upgraded the ACE 1 to have ‘smart’ capabilities. The new product comes distributed in a bundle with a smartphone with our proprietary Android ACE app pre-installed on it. This innovative pairing unlocks new features: A Pay-as-you-save model; improved customer service delivery; and quantification of social and environmental impact.

In remote parts of India, specifically in the states of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, kerosene is unavailable. If available, it is sold to the poor at exorbitant black market rates, sometimes upwards of 70 rupees per liter (a 2005 estimate). Lighting kerosene in homes is also unsafe because of noxious fumes as well the risk of fire in homes that have thatched roofs. The Aishwarya lamp, designed by Noble Energy Solar Technologies, is a solar-powered lamp that provides significantly more light than a kerosene lamp. The lantern has a life of over 10 years, and the battery must be replaced every 3 years to guarantee longevity of the product. Rather than repair the product upon damage, NEST has designed it so that key parts can be replaced for an inexpensive fee. The lantern utilizes a 3 W compact fluorescent lamp, specially manufactured for this application.\n\nIt is currently being sold in remote and poor villages in India, through dealerships that are trained by NEST. These lanterns are affordable through a payment plan that allows individual dealers and sub-dealers, who know their customers. Because of this personal relationship with customers, villagers pay on a monthly installment plan over 8 or 16 month periods (200 or 100 rupees a month). Based on their size, dealerships sell anywhere from 500 - 1000 lanterns a year, with only 3-4% of customers defaulting on payments.\n\n","id":"70","name":"Aishwarya Lantern","category":"energy","tags":"lighting","image":"ast/70-aish.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/kmf_ZEQGKOU?list=PLA432C07908427A77","user_id":"306","created":"2010-07-16 19:34","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/noble-energy-solar-technologies-aishwarya-lantern","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Mr DT Barki founded NEST in 1998 after seeing the fatal results of a kerosene-lamp fire in a house.

Furthermore, the sale of the Aishwarya lantern in villages has employed a number of people as dealers (including a handful of women), and has also allowed villagers to increase earning by giving them a safe and well-lit environment to work in. The power of the Aishwarya light is almost five times that of a traditional kerosene lamp, thus enabling children to study and read after dark. The product won an Ashden Award in 2005 for its creative design as well as its feasible payment strategy. Since then, NEST has used its award support to further publicize the Aishwarya lantern, and to fund research into more efficient PV systems.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/noble-energy-solar-technologies-aishwarya-lantern#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India  \nLocal Price: 1600 rupees  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/noble-energy-solar-technologies-aishwarya-lantern#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: https://solarnest.wordpress.com/about/  \nproducturl: https://solarnest.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/nest-aishwarya%C2%AE-6543/\n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"https://solarnest.wordpress.com/about/","producturl":"https://solarnest.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/nest-aishwarya%C2%AE-6543/","_href":"/solutions/noble-energy-solar-technologies-aishwarya-lantern#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Noble Energy Solar Technologies, Ltd.\n\n","_txt":"DT Barki  \nNoble Energy Solar Technologies, Ltd.  \nBegumpet Hyderabad  \n500 016  \nIndia  \n+91 040 2776 2559  \n[dtbarki@usa.net](mailto:dtbarki@usa.net?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Noble Energy Solar Technologies, Ltd.","_href":"/solutions/noble-energy-solar-technologies-aishwarya-lantern#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/pan-american-health-organization-alcohol-and-in-the-americas ----\nid: ieb2n6r\nname: Alcohol and Health in the Americas\ncategory: medical\nimage: /ast/ieb2n6r-screen-shot-2016-04-08-at-1.10.16-pm.png\ncreated: 2016-04-08 13:13\ntemplate: solution\npublish: ghx\ntype: publication\ntags:  ncds, promotion-and-prevention, paho\n\n","_txt":"This regional report expands on the analyses published in the global report so that policymakers, scientists, and the public can better understand where we are and what we need to do in order to reduce the harmful use of alcohol in the Region of the Americas.\n\nThis  follows the first Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) regional report titled Alcohol and Public Health in the Americas: A Case for Action, which set a benchmark for technical cooperation and country actions in the Americas.

With Talking Books, development organizations can provide access to information in local languages. Listeners can play messages on demand and use a built-in microphone to record their questions and feedback. A built-in speaker allows families and groups to listen and learn together. \n\nTalking Book content is typically produced in the form of songs, dramas, interview, and endorsements. Amplio does not create content, but can provide referrals to local partners and affiliates who provide content development services and support. \n\nBecause Amplio’s technology collects usage data and user feedback, Talking Book partners can monitor program engagement, identify issues and trends, and continually update and improve their messaging and content for greater impact.  \n\nGovernments, development organizations, and local NGOs are using Amplio’s technology to amplify their reach and share knowledge about agriculture, health, livelihoods, food and nutrition security, gender equity, protection, and more. \nPrograms that incorporate Talking Books have seen a significant impact: \n\n* A Ghana  pilot project that provided messages from local agriculture experts saw crop production increase by 48%, leading to greater food security and nutrition.\n\n\n* MEDA’s GROW project distributed Talking Books to economically empower over 23,000 women farmers in northern Ghana to improve food security and nutrition.

Babies who don’t weigh enough at birth are terribly vulnerable. Their bodies are not strong, and they may have a difficult time breathing, eating, gaining weight, and fighting infection. Babies who weigh less than 2.5 kg at birth are approximately 20 times more likely to die than heavier infants.\n\nMany babies in the developing world are delivered at home, by traditional birth attendants or midwives who may lack the training and tools to recognize low birth weight. PATH’s BIRTHweigh scale helps low-literate health workers identify low-birthweight children immediately. Once identified, these infants can be given care, such as immediate breastfeeding and warming, or referred for higher levels of medical care. The BIRTHweigh scale compensates for low levels of literacy by supplying pictorial instructions for use. It depends on a simple indicator for low birth weight and is easy to use; little training is required, allowing health workers in the developing world to detect low birth weight in infants before complications arise.\n\nTo use the BIRTHweigh scale, health workers place the baby in a secure sling that is suspended by a hook on the scale. Instead of the common digital or dial readouts that report an infant’s exact weight, the first version of the scale had a window that shows yellow if the baby’s weight is too low and blue if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kg, the desired weight for a healthy newborn.\n\nDuring tests in Indonesia—where 250,000 Indonesian infants die each year from preventable illnesses—we found that during night deliveries, in huts with little or no lighting, birth attendants were unable see the color change. PATH took the recommendations of the midwives and field testers and modified the scale to include a tactile indicator on the top of the handle. The indicator button sinks into the grip if the baby weighs at least 2.5 kilograms, and birth attendants can feel whether babies are at a healthy weight, even in the dark.\n\n","id":"139","name":"BIRTHweigh","category":"medical","type":"product","tags":"women-and-children","image":"ast/139-birthweigh-scale.jpg","user_id":"328","created":"2011-02-26 07:28","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Most recently, in response to new technologies that may allow newborns to be treated successfully in the home, PATH designed a new version of the scale, one that can identify three different weight categories. Each of these weight categories corresponds to a different dose of gentamicin, a drug used to treat severe bacterial infections. This version of the scale gives health workers a reliable tool for gauging how much medication to give a sick child. It empowers more workers to administer the drug and reduces the risk that the wrong dose will be given.\n\nPrototypes of PATH’s latest version of the BIRTHweigh scale, which is in a stage of active development, were successfully field-tested for accuracy and acceptability in Nepal and India in 2004. The scale is designed for local production and distribution, to reduce costs and stimulate economic development in the countries where the scale is used. One of the earlier versions of the scale is already in use in many countries and for sale through UNICEF under the name “BebeWey.” We are currently seeking a manufacturer to whom we can transfer the technology for the latest version, so that it will be readily available to community health workers who care for infants suffering from severe infection.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: no  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.path.org  \nproducturl: http://www.path.org/publications/detail.php?i=1016  \n  \n[ts-update-bw3.pdf](/ast/139-ts-update-bw3.pdf)  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.path.org","producturl":"http://www.path.org/publications/detail.php?i=1016","_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: PATH\n\n","_txt":"Patricia Coffey  \nPATH  \nSeattle, WA  \n98109  \nUSA  \n2062853500  \n[pcoffey@path.org](mailto:pcoffey@path.org?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"PATH","_href":"/solutions/path-birthweigh#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/brck ----\nid: 501\nname: BRCK\ncategory: education\ntags: connectivity, devices\nimage: /ast/501-promo-brck.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/qsJYrwzfd6w\nuser_id: 484\ncreated: 2014-05-06 20:44\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"BRCK is a device that brings the internet to remote locations, even without electricity.\n\nThe BRCK’s backup battery and multiple ways of connecting to various networks offers users consistent connectivity even when networks are down and power is sporadic.

It has been developed with a vision to provide a sustainable irrigation solution to farmers across the world. This waterwheel utilizes energy from the flow of rivers and canals to pump water, regardless of the flow velocity.\n\nThe Barsha pump provides a sustainable solution to farmers across the world. It works on the principle of spiral pumping, using the kinetic energy of the waterwheel to pump water to higher elevations without the need for active mechanical parts to create pumping action. The pump consists of spirals where air is compressed between water columns resulting in air pressure that lifts the water.\n\nThe current version with a 1.5m diameter is able to lift up to a vertical head of 20 meters, and to deliver water 2km inland through flat lands, while reaching up to 40,000 liters of water per day, depending on the flow velocity of the water.\n\nThe water pumped can be used to flood fields or it can be pumped to a reservoir in order to couple with an irrigation system such as a sprinkler.\n\n","id":"sa2424p","name":"Barsha Pump","category":["agriculture","partners","water"],"tags":["empowering-people","collection-storage-and-transport","irrigation"],"image":"ast/barshapump.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/4QE24BntS1Y","created":"2016-12-13 11:28","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/aqysta-barsha-pump","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The Barsha pump is made with indigenous elements and does not need much maintenance as there are only a few moving parts. As a result of these factors, the Barsha pump can save over 70% of watering costs for farmers, compared to conventionally-used fossil-fuel based pumps.\nThe pumps have been implemented in areas such as Nepal and Indonesia, where barren lands are being cultivated only once a year in the rainy season. Farmers could not farm in the dry season due to lack of irrigation, and the costs of using kerosene or gasoline pumps were prohibitive. When the Barsha pump was implemented, farmers could farm different cash crops in the dry season as well, helping to increase their income level.\n\nIn addition to commercial farms, aQysta also aims to support farmers who wish to shift from subsistence to commercial farming by providing irrigation facilities, in partnership with other development organizations. Whereas the end users of the technology are always farmers, the customers can range from individual farmers to farmer co-operatives, development organizations/projects to government bodies.\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/aqysta-barsha-pump#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: Yes  \nCountries where available: Globally  \nPrice range: Contact supplier for quote  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/aqysta-barsha-pump#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 1.5 meters in Diameter  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/aqysta-barsha-pump#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.aqysta.com/  \nproducturl: http://www.aqysta.com/product  \n  \n\n","_txt":"","url":"http://www.aqysta.com/","producturl":"http://www.aqysta.com/product","_href":"/solutions/aqysta-barsha-pump#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: aQysta\nurl: http://www.aqysta.com/\n\n","_txt":"aQysta  \nMolengraaffsingel 12-14  \n2629JD Delft    \nThe Netherlands  \n[lennart@aQysta.com](mailto:lennart@aQysta.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)\n","name":"aQysta","url":"http://www.aqysta.com/","_href":"/solutions/aqysta-barsha-pump#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/basicneeds ----\nid: 484\nname: BasicNeeds\ncategory: medical\ntype: product\nimage: /ast/484-basic-needs-logo.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/GnKygJ1WUrg\nuser_id: 737\ncreated: 2014-04-09 17:20\ntemplate: solution\npublish: ghx\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"BasicNeeds works with over 90 organizations to bring community-based models for mental health to the developing world.

Water is poured into the top of the unit and is filtered as it passes through the sand. The raw water is biologically improved partially through predation in the biological or 'schmutzdecke' layer as well as the sand providing a natural mechanical barrier. \n\nThe mould unit is an all steel construction manufactured to a high quality and finish. The main parts of the mould unit are shown in the exploded view below, these are: 1) the puller, 2) an inner mould, and 3) outer mould. The mould is simply bolted together, turned upside down and fitted with a copper outlet pipe. A concrete mix is then poured in the mould and compacted down. After several hours the puller is used to remove the inner mould after which the outer mould can be removed revealing the finished filter shell. The filter is then filled with sand and gravel layers. \n\nContaminated water is poured into the unit at the top. The water passes through the diffuser plate and the sand and gravel layers. Head pressure pushes water through the copper pipe in the base to the outlet point. Biological contamination is reduced through the actions of adsorption; mechanical filtering, predation (‘biological layer’) and natural die off. The actual round concrete BSF units produced are approximately 915mm high with an outer and inner diameter of 355mm and 295mm respectively. The filter depth is approximately 450mm with a surface area of around 0.07m2.

To improve this IaW were keen to follow the experience of Medair and their round BSF because of the advantages that this type of unit offered. Typical cost for square filters moulds made by local workshops and other NGO’s have been around $350. To reduce the cost of the roundB SF mould we are  urrently working on utilizing and making modifications to existing moulds used for producing cement pipes (for storm drainage). These basic moulds cost around $85 for the standard mould and are widely available throughout the country and the skills and production facilities for making these are well established. These standard pipe moulds can be modified to allow the base to be sealed off and to add the additional nose cone as standard. The cost of final modified mould is estimated to be around $150 which is less than 50% of the square filter moulds. The amount of concrete used in the round filter is around 20% less as well which provides significant savings on materials costs as well.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Cambodia  \nPrice range (USD): 100 to 200 USD  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 915mm height  x 355mm outer diameter / flow rate 0.6ltr/minute  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.ideas-at-work.org  \nproducturl: http://www.ideas-at-work.org/our-ideas/round-bio-sand-filter  \n  \n[round-bio-sand-filter.pdf](/ast/38-round-bio-sand-filter.pdf)  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.ideas-at-work.org","producturl":"http://www.ideas-at-work.org/our-ideas/round-bio-sand-filter","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Ideas at Work\n\n","_txt":"Ideas at Work  \nPhnom Penh  \nCambodia  \n+855 24 399 577  \n[info@ideas-at-work.org](mailto:info@ideas-at-work.org?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n\n\n","name":"Ideas at Work","_href":"/solutions/ideas-at-work-bio-sand-filter#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/banka-bioloo-pvt-bio-toilets ----\nid: 559\nname: Bio-toilets\ncategory: water\ntags: sanitation\nimage: /ast/559-mobile-bio-toilet.jpg\nuser_id: 847\ncreated: 2014-09-28 17:44\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"Banka Bioloo provides eco-friendly and sustainable solutions for sanitation in rural, urban and peri-urban areas.

The mechanisms within the filter include both mechanical and biological processes. Mechanical processes include straining, adhesion and adsorption within the sand, whereas biological processes include predation by other organisms, die-off and inactivation and competition for food.\n\nAs micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses and parasites travel through the sand, they are subject to both of these removal mechanisms. Over time, a biological zone gradually develops within the top layers the sand, the most dense/active part being the top few centimetres of sand – the origins of this biological population being the raw water fed into the filter. These micro-organisms form part of an active food chain that consumes pathogens (disease-causing organisms) as they are trapped in and on the sand surface, and in so doing the pathogens are removed and safe drinking water is produced. \n\nBioSandFilter.org is a resource website linking efforts by field practitioners and academics doing research on the biosand filter. It gives filter and mould instructions for those who want to make their own. Equally, for those that require it, moulds can be bought by BushProof, the Madagascar-based company that owns BioSandFilter.org.

Terra Preta is more than 5000 years practice in parts of Amazon basin until the Europeans arrived. Along with charcoal the rural trash consisting of pottery shards, fish bones, compost, etc. was added to the less fertile acidic soils to improve fertility of the soils. The biochar application is useful as a means of carbon sequestration and mitigating global warming issues too.\n\nThe value of charcoal was known to Indians and utilized as part of traditional and cultural practices for various purposes. The charcoal was never considered as a waste material. The crop residue burnt in the fields gets converted into charcoal and ash. In the process, the earth (soil) also gets burnt. This practice benefited the soils and farmers since ages (here no comparison with composting the biomass). The slash and burn in the margins of the forests or inside the forests is a very well known practice all over India (although it is no more sustainable because of huge population demands and costing the sustainability of forests). The charcoal, a byproduct of the traditional stoves is added to the farm yard manure / compost, which gets inoculated with the soil microbes, which was later transferred to the fields. The waste from the potters kiln a combination of charcoal, pottery shards and little ash was always a valuable source for improving the fertility of the soils. Although the addition of charcoal to the soils was existing as a practice, but it was not explicit, it remained as part of traditional best practices in India. As we explore more and more evidences are visible and proves that the Indian farmers were using charcoal since hundreds of years. Because of such good practices agricultural activity is still sustainable in many parts of India.\n\n","id":"192","name":"Biochar Production and Application","category":["agriculture","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","productivity-tools, methods-and-learning"],"image":"ast/192-biochar.png","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/jHWuhb9cwfI","user_id":"370","created":"2011-11-06 01:05","template":"solution","no publish":"1","feature":"tel","_href":"/solutions/geoecology-energy-organisation-geo-biochar-production-and-application","#summary":{"_hdr":"---- #summary ----\n\n","_txt":"The Geoecology Energy Organisation is now promoting the production of biochar, a pure carbon charcoal obtained by burning plant and agricultural waste in confined spaces.

The bottles are used solely as insulation; the buildings are supported by professionally built, structurally sound frames. This method of construction is both eco-friendly and economical, and independent structural analysis has testified to the strength and safety of the buildings.\n\nIn our first project in Granados, Guatemala, in October 2009, over 5,000 plastic bottles were used to build two classrooms, containing 2053lbs of trash and using 9720lbs of cement. 297 children and youth currently attend the school, which serves a municipality of 13,860 people throughout 95.75 square miles.\n\nSince the completion of the Granados project, we have completed 9 more bottle schools, have 3more projects in progress, and more sites under evaluation for possible projects. We can build a bottle school for  around $12,000.\n\n","id":"170","name":"Bottle Schools","category":["education","housing"],"tags":"housing-and-shelter","image":"ast/170-full-1316219243-d1aff8291c-z.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/k3gl1wWJdTM","user_id":"360","created":"2011-10-16 04:34","template":"solution","no publish":"1","_href":"/solutions/hug-it-foward-bottle-schools","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Bottle School projects have many benefits, including:\n\n- Providing much needed educational infrastructure for poorer communities\nCleaning the streets of non-biodegradable trash\n- Teaching environmental awareness, recycling and proper trash management \n- Fostering community leadership\n- Teaching new skills that can be used to gain employment or on other community projects\n- Spending capital within the local community where the school is being built\n- Giving kids ownership of the school, because they build it with their own hands\n- Uniting communities, they come together as one during the project\n\n","_href":"/solutions/hug-it-foward-bottle-schools#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Guatemala  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Guatemala  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/hug-it-foward-bottle-schools#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://hugitforward.org  \nproducturl: http://hugitforward.org/bottle-schools/what-is-a-bottle-school  \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://hugitforward.org","producturl":"http://hugitforward.org/bottle-schools/what-is-a-bottle-school","_href":"/solutions/hug-it-foward-bottle-schools#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Hug It Foward\n\n","_txt":"Whitney Ball  \nHug It Foward  \n Gatemala  \nGuatemala  \n[ whitney@hugitforward.org](mailto:whitney@hugitforward.org?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n\n\n","name":"Hug It Foward","_href":"/solutions/hug-it-foward-bottle-schools#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/funda-o-oswaldo-cruz-brazil-s-south-structural-cooperation-in-health ----\nid: hq4f6y2\nname: Brazil’s South-South Structural Cooperation in Health\ncategory: medical\ntype: product\nimage: /ast/hq4f6y2-screen-shot-2016-03-22-at-2.54.03-pm.png\ncreated: 2016-03-22 15:00\ntemplate: solution\npublish: ghx\ntype: publication\ntype: policy\n\n","_txt":"This paper examines the Brazilian conception of horizontal “structural cooperation in health”.

With Brilliance, hospitals can save over $200 per year on costly bulb replacements;\n- Brilliance consumes half the power of compact fluorescent tube lights. In case of blackout, it can be run off a battery back-up (the size of a car battery) for up to 8 hours;\n- Designed for extreme durability including protections against voltage surges, high use and other environmental challenges with minimal required maintenance;\n- Height and tilt adjustments to accommodate use with other critical NICU devices and meets UNICEF phototherapy specifications and can be used with hospital beds, bassinets and other treatment surfaces.\n\nWhereas the standard compact fluorescent light phototherapy devices only treat 42 babies before bulb replacement is required to maintain its effectiveness, a Brilliance device is estimated to treat approximately 1,042 babies.\n\n","id":"309","name":"Brilliance: Neonatal Jaundice Treatment","category":"medical","type":"product","tags":"medical-and-surgical, women-and-children, medical-devices","image":"ast/309-d-rev-brilliance-product-small.png","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/0lVe4yf9_4Q","user_id":"484","created":"2013-04-23 14:19","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/d-rev-brilliance-neonatal-jaundice-treatment","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"In late 2010, D-Rev licensed Brilliance to Chennai-based Phoenix Medical Systems.

Respiratory Distress caused 80% of neonatal mortality at NHP, and nationwide 45% of newborns with Respiratory Distress died within 24 hours from birth in 2005. At that time, neonatal emergency care was concentrated in central hospitals which had limited equipment and were hard to reach for most families, therefore many infants were left without adequate care. After implementing MTTS equipment at the national, provincial and referral hospitals, the neonatal 24h-mortality has decreased significantly both at the NHP and in the whole country.\n\nThe equipment has been developed and produced in Vietnam by Medical Technology Transfer and Services (MTTS) on the base of Western standards, but with adjustments to the needs and requirements of low-cost settings and tropical climates. Priorities for MTTS are ease of use, affordability, durability, safety and precise measurement. The CPAP has been distributed mostly through the East Meets West Foundation’s Breath of Life Program, combined with intensive training, follow up, data collection and technical assistance.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/medical-technology-transfer-services-cpap-v3#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Philippines, Myanmar, East Timor, India, Benin, Ghana  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/medical-technology-transfer-services-cpap-v3#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.mtts-asia.com/  \nproducturl: http://www.mtts-asia.com/cpap-v3/  \n  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.mtts-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CPAP-V3-MKT-01-CPAP-Brochure-2.00EN_NEW.pdf)  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.mtts-asia.com/","producturl":"http://www.mtts-asia.com/cpap-v3/","[Documentation, article, or review](http":"//www.mtts-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CPAP-V3-MKT-01-CPAP-Brochure-2.00EN_NEW.pdf)","_href":"/solutions/medical-technology-transfer-services-cpap-v3#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Medical Technology Transfer Services\n\n","_txt":"Medical Technology Transfer Services  \nHanoi  \nVietnam  \n+84 43 7666 521  \n[info@mtts-asia.com](mailto:info@mtts-asia.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Medical Technology Transfer Services","_href":"/solutions/medical-technology-transfer-services-cpap-v3#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/compatible-technology-international-cti-shredder ----\nid: 586\nname: CTI Shredder\ncategory: agriculture\ncategory: partners\ntags:     empowering-people\ntags: productivity-tools\nimage: /ast/586-cti-shredder.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/dn_C05SCkSs?list=UUpMazsY8fz2IH0FiLB0_Ugw\nuser_id: 811\ncreated: 2014-11-25 03:22\ntemplate: solution\nno publish: 1\n\n","_txt":"The CTI Shredder enables farmers and small enterprises to transform spoilage-prone fruits and vegetables into shreds that can be dried and processed into high-value food products.

Field experience and clinical test results have shown this filter to effectively eliminate approximately 99.88% of most water born disease agents.\n\nThe filter design used by PFP was developed by Dr. Fernando Mazariegos of the Central American Industrial Research Institute (ICAITI) in Guatemala, in 1981. The goal was to make bacterially contaminated water safe for the poorest of the poor by developing a low cost filter which could be fabricated at the community level.\n\nIn 1994 AFA or Family Foundation of the Americas, a Guatemalan organization, became interested in the ceramic water filter when it was found that other strategies were not yielding effective results. Chlorine tablets in rural communities were not well accepted; health complications associated with chlorine misuse caused additional concern. Boiled water often wasn’t effective when households failed to boil water long enough to purify it. AFA carried out a one year follow-up study on the initial Mazariegos-led filter project, concluding that including this filter into rural health education efforts reduced the incidence of diarrhea in participating households by as much as 50 percent.\n\nIn October 1998, Hurricane Mitch tore through Central America. It was one of the most destructive hurricanes ever recorded, affecting millions of people. Safe water was urgently needed as supply systems (already of borderline capacity and efficiency) had been badly damaged. This prompted Potters for Peace to begin a Ceramic Water Filter production workshop in Nicaragua using the Mazariegos design.\nIn the first six months over 5000 filters were distributed through non-governmental organizations. The workshop, called Filtron, evolved into a worker-owned cooperative and is now incorporated as a privately owned business.\n\nPotters for Peace has since provided consultation and training to set up production facilities around the world: Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Ghana, El Salvador, the Darfur region of Sudan, Kenya, Benin, Yemen, Nigeria, Tanzania, Peru, Somaliland and others.\n\nThe CWP has been cited by the United Nations’ Appropriate Technology Handbook, and tens of thousands of filters have been distributed worldwide by organizations such as International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, Doctors Without Borders, UNICEF, Plan International, Project Concern International, Oxfam and USAID.\n\nWe have financed or assisted in laboratory testing and field studies of the filter with various institutions, among them: MIT, Tulane University, University of Colorado and University of North Carolina.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice (USD): 15-25  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 11\" wide x 10\" deep  \nWeight: 15kg  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.pottersforpeace.org/  \nproducturl: https://pottersforpeace.org/?page_id=63 \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.pottersforpeace.org/","producturl":"https://pottersforpeace.org/?page_id=63","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Potters for Peace\n\n","_txt":"Kaira  Wagoner  \nPotters for Peace  \nGreensboro, NC  \n27407  \nUSA  \n520-249-8093  \n[pottersforpeace@gmail.com](mailto:pottersforpeace@gmail.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Potters for Peace","_href":"/solutions/potters-for-peace-ceramic-water-filter#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/resource-development-international-ceramic-water-filtration-system ----\nid: 32\nname: Ceramic Water Filtration System\ncategory: water\ntags: water-purification\nimage: /ast/32-rdic-water-filter.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/EU3rRiWsRE0\nuser_id: 118\ncreated: 2010-01-01 00:00\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"The Resource Development International  - Cambodia (RDIC) ceramic water filter is a low-cost solution for filtering water for communities who otherwise do not have access to safe drinking water.

By September 2007 RDIC had distributed approximately 60,000 filters throughout Cambodia, and internationally, with 24,000 produced in 2007.\n\nCeramic water filters have proven to be tremendously effective in reducing the exposure of users to contaminated water, and the incidence diarrhea over an extended period of time (Brown and Sobsey, 2006). \n\nField trials of the effectiveness of ceramic water filters in Cambodia over time showed a 46% reduction in diarrheal disease between filter users and non-users, a 95.1% average (and up to 99.99%) reduction of E.coli in drinking water (Brown and Sobsey, 2006).  \n\nLaboratory testing has shown a 90-99% reduction in viruses (Brown, 2007). These results support other trials of ceramic water filters (Lantagne, 2001) as a highly successful means of empowering households to manage their own safe water supply.\n\nRDIC continues to invest significant time and energy into developing its processes and would like to share its knowledge and best practice approaches with organisations who wish to have a similarly positive impact on communities in developing countries.\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/resource-development-international-ceramic-water-filtration-system#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Cambodia  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/resource-development-international-ceramic-water-filtration-system#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.rdic.org  \nproducturl: http://rdic.org/ceramic-water-filters/  \n\n","_txt":"[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.rdic.org/db/download/index.php)  \n[cambodian-filter-factories.pdf](/ast/32-cambodian-filter-factories.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n","url":"http://www.rdic.org","producturl":"http://rdic.org/ceramic-water-filters/","_href":"/solutions/resource-development-international-ceramic-water-filtration-system#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Resource Development International\n\n","_txt":"No 50A, Phum Prek Thom Sangkat Kbal Koh  \nKhan Chbar Ampov  \nPhnom Penh  \nKingdom of Cambodia  \n855 (0)12-200-235   \n[info@rdic.org](mailto:info@rdic.org?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n\n\n","name":"Resource Development International","_href":"/solutions/resource-development-international-ceramic-water-filtration-system#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/changamka ----\nid: 494\nname: Changamka\ncategory: medical\ntype: product\ntags:  mobile-health\nimage: /ast/494-index.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/64vRr5eAPxc\nuser_id: 737\ncreated: 2014-04-10 18:52\ntemplate: solution\npublish: ghx\nfeature: ghx\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"Changamka runs a mobile money transfer technology.

It is comprised of a self-washing clarifier and filter system to purify water and provide centralized treatment to communities. A single modular unit can provide water treatment for 1300 people at 15 L/person/day.   \n\nThe system is replicable and scalable and requires no power supply to operate. A modular version for rapid deployment can be locally assembled in a workshop setting, and does not require a manufacturing process. Alternatively, units can be made in the UK and exported to the site/country required.\n\nThe backwash system has no moving parts and requires no external power, therefore it requires no operator intervention to facilitate backwashing. Both the tube settler and filter are washed in the same wash cycle. No chemicals are used (dependant on water quality) other than chlorine tablets. \n\nThe process comprises of:\n* Inlet cavitating static mixer which reduces the repellent charge on particles allowing agglomeration to occur\n* Inlet aeration to precipitate dissolved iron etc\n* Inlet reservoir which provides water for siphon priming and residence time\n* Tube settler which increases particle settling velocities. Settlement cloud in the transition zone between turbulent and lamellar flow intercepts more particles reducing filtration load allowing more turbid water to be treated\n* Pressure filtration nominally at 10m/h but adjustable to suit water quality. Advanced filtration media for best water quality although filter sand can be used.\n* Chlorination and disinfection before supply\n* The system utilises a siphon to reverse flow & backwash the filter. \n\nA full diagram of the system is shown under Additional Information below.\n\n\n","id":"14mbnqwt","name":"ClariWash Self Washing Filtration System","category":"water","tags":"water-purification","image":"ast/clari-wash-uganda.jpeg","created":"2017-10-20 10:25","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/waterreach-clariwash-self-washing-filtration-system","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The system has been developed over the last few years from an initial concept to small scale models and then a University test rig.

After further development and engineering, Khosla came up with a micro-controller with an intelligent algorithm which knows when to cycle the compressor off and on.\n\nCurrently, there are over 27,000 CoolBots in over 50 countries being used for vegetables, fruits, meat, dairy products and more.\n\n<!---CoolBot uses new patented technology and multiple sensors and a micro-controller \"brain\" that intelligently interfaces with an air conditioner - controlling and co-ordinating its output so that you can access nearly all your cooling power, even as you keep temperatures in your walk-in cooler (or any highly insulated room) in the 30's without re-wiring and without any freeze-ups.\n\nThe obvious solution was that we needed a brain.

The platform helps build infrastructural capacity through low-cost, yet high-quality innovative technologies for more efficient educational solutions that address UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In line with the world’s best practices, DASARAN disrupts the entire public education ecosystem by helping meet educational-technological development goals, advancing evidence-based decision-making, improving student performance, and augmenting teacher capacity. \nThe platform’s impact is achieved through some major components:\n* Distance-Learning Toolset allowing teachers to create online courses in the subjects of their instruction and deliver the courses directly to their class students. Furthermore, the Distance-Learning Toolset integrates a Knowledge-Assessment Mechanism, through which teachers can quickly add quizzes to the courses and assess their students’ knowledge of the particular subject areas and topics.\n* A learning management system that combines classroom management, journals to help track assignments and homework, student performance statistics, etc., provides insights to all education stakeholders and promotes transparency in public schools. The system helps schools set standards and establish routines (such as annual reports, yearly school report cards, etc.) to further build their capacity, sustainability, and withstand changes in school administration and political priorities.\n* A data analytics tool for educational policy-making allows for effective monitoring of schools and a more accurate measurement of education indicators across a country. The tool provides real-time statistical data and comparative analysis on school management efficiency, school enrolment, and student performance using various indicators. This helps policymakers to analyze educational conditions and to assess the different diagnostic information to bring quality education to every student.\n* Customized e-learning and gamified education approach, encompassing a wide knowledge base that covers a wide range of topics as disaster risk reduction, environmental protection, energy conservation, human rights, constitutional rights, intercultural learning, social inclusion, tolerance among others.

Every hole is equipped with a laser beam, broken by the nose of the rat. A rat only needs a few hundredths of a second to discriminate the target odor. In case of a negative sample the rat immediately moves on to the next sample. Positive samples are indicated by keeping their nose fixed in the sniffer hole for at least three seconds, which is registered in a database.\n\nKnown positives are inserted to allow reinforcement of indication behavior. At three seconds indication of known positive samples, the animals hear a click sound and they receive a food reward. Rat-detected suspect samples are re-tested for the presence of TB using concentrated smear and LED microscopy.\n\nThe rats evaluate 100 saliva samples within 20 minutes, which would take a lab technician more than two days using microscopy.

Respiratory Distress caused 80% of neonatal mortality at NHP, and nationwide 45% of newborns with Respiratory Distress died within 24 hours from birth in 2005. At that time, neonatal emergency care was concentrated in central hospitals which had limited equipment and were hard to reach for most families, therefore many infants were left without adequate care.

They provide water savings of 30-70 percent, greatly reduce labor, and accurately deliver fertilizers. This makes cultivation during the dry season possible, with resulting yield increases of up to 30 percent.\n\nThere are three different models:\n\nMicrotube Drip Irrigation Systems\nNarrow micro-tubes bring water to the base of each plant from soft flat water lines. Inserting these micro-tubes into the water lines and ensuring that they remain unblocked takes effort. However, the system offers many advantages, including water savings of 30–70 percent as compared to traditional surface irrigation methods, improved yield and quality of crops, and reduced irrigation labor.\n\nButton Emitter Drip Irrigation Systems\nThe button emitters are an optional add-on to pre-punched drip irrigation tape, and when installed they direct a steady flow of water to the desired spot.

During the process, arsenite (which is more toxic and difficult to remove) is converted into arsenate, allowing the process to be highly effective under robust conditions. Treated water exceeds international WHO standards for arsenic and iron across many groundwater sources. The electrodes are cleaned by reversing the current, making operation and maintenance simple and non-hazardous. The technology was designed to work within a sustainable service delivery model that can cover the cost of an electricity source and still sell arsenic-safe water at a locally affordable price while simultaneously covering all costs.\n\nThe requirements for maintenance are low and electrode passivation can be limited by reversing voltage regularly. Operating ECAR is simple and non-hazardous: voltage is very low (about 3 V DC) and no corrosive chemicals are needed. ECAR can be operated by trained local community members.  \n\nOperating costs are extremely low (~ 0.04 USD/l), making it possible to sell the arsenic-safe water at a locally affordable price while simultaneously covering the expenses.\n\n","id":"398","name":"ECAR: Arsenic-Safe Drinking Water","category":["water","partners"],"tags":["empowering-people","water-purification"],"image":"ast/398-csm-02-img-2743-67c5104dc5.jpg","video":"//player.vimeo.com/video/51606377","user_id":"484","created":"2013-11-26 21:17","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/lawrence-berkeley-national-lab-usa-ecar-arsenic-safe-drinking-water","#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/lawrence-berkeley-national-lab-usa-ecar-arsenic-safe-drinking-water#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://gadgillab.berkeley.edu  \nproducturl: http://gadgillab.berkeley.edu/research/water/arsenic_removal/  \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://gadgillab.berkeley.edu","producturl":"http://gadgillab.berkeley.edu/research/water/arsenic_removal/","_href":"/solutions/lawrence-berkeley-national-lab-usa-ecar-arsenic-safe-drinking-water#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Lawrence Berkeley National Lab/USA\n\n","_txt":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab/USA  \nBerkeley, CA  \nUnited States  \n[Contact](http://gadgillab.berkeley.edu/contact/)  \n","name":"Lawrence Berkeley National Lab/USA","_href":"/solutions/lawrence-berkeley-national-lab-usa-ecar-arsenic-safe-drinking-water#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/ide-earth-mound-bag ----\nid: 617\nname: Earth Mound Bag\ncategory: agriculture\ncategory: water\ntags: irrigation, collection-storage-and-transport\nimage: /ast/617-download.jpeg\nuser_id: 922\ncreated: 2015-02-24 16:08\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"Earth mound supported bags supply drip irrigation systems for 1000-2000 square meter plots.

The donkey carts were a success; more than 500 were sold, producing $1 million of net income for cart owners.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/ide-earth-mound-bag#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/ide-earth-mound-bag#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.ideorg.org/  \nproducturl: http://ide-india.org/content/5000-ltr-water-storage-bag  \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.ideorg.org/","producturl":"http://ide-india.org/content/5000-ltr-water-storage-bag","_href":"/solutions/ide-earth-mound-bag#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: iDE\n\n","_txt":"iDE  \nDenver, CO  \n80205  \nUnited States  \n720-924-1227  \n[info@ideglobal.org](mailto:info@ideglobal.org?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)\n\nIDE (India)\nPlot No.10, Local Shopping Centre,\nAdjacent Bal Bhavan International School Sector-12, Dwarka, New Delhi- 110078\n+91-9711478606\n   \n\n\n","name":"iDE","_href":"/solutions/ide-earth-mound-bag#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/relief-labs-international-easytomato ----\nid: 668\nname: EasyTomato\ncategory: education\ntags: mobile-and-desktop-applications-edu\nimage: /ast/668-668-easytomato-opt.png\nuser_id: 922\ncreated: 2015-03-19 16:46\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"EasyTomato is a simple way to control who uses your internet, how they use it, and when they use it.

While standard walls may develop cracks in the plasterwork that carry through the entire wall, cracks do not develop throughout sandbag walls.\n\nOnce the framework is in place, filling and stacking sandbags may be undertaken by unskilled workers or by the owners themselves, reducing labor costs and potentially providing job opportunities to the local community. Much of the sand required to build the structure can be obtained on-site.\n\nThis form of construction is ideal in isolated areas, as the weight and design of the construction material makes it easy to transport. Adoption of the Eco-Beam Sandbag system can decrease building costs while remaining environmentally friendly. \n\nEco-Beam Sandbag homes can be produced and built in a short period of time, as no masonry is necessary.

Within 20 minutes, the pouch will heat up to 37C (98.6F), a temperature critical to a child’s survival.\n- Place the heated pouch into the sleeping bag warmer and lay the baby inside. The pouch can be reheated hundreds of times. An indicator shows when it needs to be reheated.\n- The pouch will remain between 37-35C for at least four hours. The phase-change material will absorb heat from the baby if the baby gets too hot, or release heat if the baby gets too cold.\n\n","id":"229","name":"Embrace Infant Warmer","category":["medical","partners"],"type":"product","tags":["100-under-100","women-and-children"],"image":"ast/229-embrace-warmer.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/LjKpYjCVTMQ","user_id":"393","created":"2012-04-09 04:59","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/embrace-infant-warmer","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"20,000,000 low-birth-weight and premature babies are born each year. This occurs primarily in developing countries, often in areas that don’t have access to innovations in modern medicine. One of the biggest problems these babies face is hypothermia: they are not able to regulate their own body temperature, and therefore cannot stay warm. In fact, room temperature for these small infants feels freezing cold. 4 million babies die within their first month of life. Those that do survive often develop life-long health problems such as early onset of diabetes, heart disease, and low IQ.\n\nTraditional incubators cost up to $20,000. Many of these babies could be saved with an incubator, but traditional incubators are expensive and not available, nor appropriate, for rural areas that don’t have access to electricity. “Many premature babies are never given a chance to make it out of the hospital,\"\" says Crystal, a missionary in Uganda, “Because there are no incubators, the babies are left to die. They are put on a table or directly in the trash without the comforting touch of their mothers in those final moments.” In light of these constraints, current solutions are in-home remedies. Desperate methods create to take care of these vulnerable babies include wrapping hot water bottles around their bodies or placing them near ovens. These solutions are unsafe and cause many infants to die unnecessarily. If given simple and proper medical treatment, many would not only survive, but grow and thrive.\n\nEmbrace donates the low-cost Infant Warmer to populations in need through establishing partnerships with like-minded NGOs who are serving our target communities. Emergency Embrace, their humanitarian assistance program, supplies Infant Warmers to organizations working in areas facing dire situations on a short-term basis. Embrace is currently working in India and in emergency settings globally on a case by case basis. They aim to expand their programs by creating partnerships with local NGOs to distribute infant warmers around the world.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/embrace-infant-warmer#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/embrace-infant-warmer#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://embraceglobal.org/  \nproducturl: http://embraceglobal.org/embrace-warmer  \n  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://embraceglobal.org/main/news)  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://embraceglobal.org/","producturl":"http://embraceglobal.org/embrace-warmer","[Documentation, article, or review](http":"//embraceglobal.org/main/news)","_href":"/solutions/embrace-infant-warmer#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Embrace\n\n","_txt":"Embrace  \nSan Francisco, CA  \n94117  \nUnited States  \n+1 (415) 663-6202  \n[info@embraceinnovations.com](mailto:info@embraceinnovations.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Embrace","_href":"/solutions/embrace-infant-warmer#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/butyl-products-emergency-water-storage-units ----\nid: 43\nname: Emergency Water Storage Units\ncategory: water\ntags: collection-storage-and-transport\nimage: /ast/43-demountabletankd.jpg\nuser_id: 118\ncreated: 2010-01-01 00:00\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"The water storage equipment consists of kits for 45m3, 70m3, 95m3, and 11m3 capacity “Oxfam” tanks made with steel sheets and rubber liners, a range of lightweight rapid response PVC tanks, and a variety of complementary kits designed to assist in tank erection.\n\nThe 11m3 litre Oxfam Water Storage Tank is suitable for use in situations where a group of 500-1,000 people are living in temporary accommodation such as hospitals or feeding centres, or where a larger number are coming each day, for example to collect rations.

Installed as a permanent structure, the Enviro Loo never requires replacement, relocation or removal.\n\nThe Enviro Loo is a \"dry or waterless sanitation system\". Liquid and solid waste are separated as they enter the container via the toilet bowl. Liquid waste drains to the bottom of the container while solid waste remains on the drying plate. The waste is exposed to continuous airflow that is driven through the unit by the forced aeration ventilation system. The movement of air is assisted by the ventilation extraction unit positioned on top of the outlet vent pipe. As the air moves through the system, it dehydrates the solid waste as it migrates down the sloped drying plate. The liquid that has drained to the bottom of the container evaporates. Sunlight absorbed by the black inspection cover increases the ambient temperature within the container.\n\nThe intense heat, prolonged retention periods and oxygen-rich air that is drawn in dehydrate and decompose the waste. At the end of this process the waste is converted via the stimulated bacterial and biological activity into an inoffensive, stabilized material which is reduced to roughly 5% of its original volume. The negative pressure within the container prevents the escape of any odor through the toilet bowl or the air inlet pipes.\n\nCurrently, there are four Enviro Loo models available with the same standard of materials and principles. The differences reside in capacity and unit specifications. The solutions are catered to domestic, communal and industrial uses.

The founders believe mobile phones provide an unprecedented and disruptive opportunity to change how markets work for both businesses and consumers.\n\nOn one hand, Esoko collects and provides content such as prices, bids and offers, weather, and agricultural tips to which users can subscribe. On the other, Esoko provides a powerful set of tools so that organizations can manage their own information and content: not only pushing out alerts and advisories to the field, but also tracking information from the field (like activities, compliance, profiles).\n\nSmallholder farmers can sign up to Esoko to receive a package of weekly advisory services. This typically consists of current market prices, matching bids and offers, weather forecasts, and news and tips.\nNot only can farmers negotiate better prices, choose different markets, or time sales better, but they may also participate in outgrower schemes through Esoko profiling and reputational history. The goal is simply to put more money into the hands of smallholder farmers, and try to address the information asymmetry that exists where farmers are frequently disadvantaged price-takers, often selling at a loss. After receiving better information, income improvements for farmers are estimated to be between 10-30%. Sometimes individual sales to new markets can increase by 100%.

Because one lens is the exact inversion of the other, the moment they are placed exactly behind each other the strength of the lens is zero. Converting the lens along the x-axis changes the intensity of the Alvarez lens. Doing the same thing for the y-axis changes the astigmatic correction of the Alvarez lens. The Alvarez lens rectifies all refraction and astigmatic deviations by displacing one lens over the x- and y-axis and by turning the complete lens around the z-axis (optical axis).    \n\nThe lenses of the Focusspec are made of high-quality polycarbonate. The frame and temples are made of industrial-grade plastics. The frame, lenses and the worm wheel are put together by ultrasonic welding, making the spectacles less vulnerable to dust and dirt. Silicone parts are used in the newest model of the Focusspec to make the glasses fit around different noses.\n\nApproximately 80% of the people who need refractive correction can be helped with Focusspec glasses.\n\n\n","id":"512","name":"Focusspec","category":["medical","partners"],"type":"product","tags":["100-under-100","medical-and-surgical"],"image":"ast/512-vision.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/h48qyTbsDYs","user_id":"737","created":"2014-06-25 18:39","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/focus-on-vision-focusspec","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Approximately 3.5 billion people today have an eye condition which requires most of them to wear glasses (or lenses) to see properly.\n\nOn a visit to Tanzania in 2002, Frederik van Asbeck, a young Dutch student who is myopic, discovered that people with poor vision in Tanzania could not get their sight problems checked and resolved, simply because there was not any eye care service to speak of.\n\nAs approximately 80% of the cases of poor vision can be helped with refractive correction (i.e. with glasses), he got involved in a project to develop adjustable glasses on the basis of the Alvarez principle at the University.\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/focus-on-vision-focusspec#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide   \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/focus-on-vision-focusspec#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.focus-on-vision.org/en/home/  \nproducturl: http://www.focus-on-vision.org/en/home/  \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.focus-on-vision.org/en/home/","producturl":"http://www.focus-on-vision.org/en/home/","_href":"/solutions/focus-on-vision-focusspec#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Focus On Vision\n\n","_txt":"Focus On Vision  \nEindhoven  \n5657 EB  \nThe Netherlands   \n8187.36.392  \n[info@focus-on-vision.org](mailto:info@focus-on-vision.org?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Focus On Vision","_href":"/solutions/focus-on-vision-focusspec#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/free-wheelchair-mission-custom ----\nid: 152\nname: Free Wheelchair Mission Custom Wheelchair\ncategory: medical\ntype: product\nimage: /ast/152-africa4.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/Z9WPexU-etU\nuser_id: 306\ncreated: 2011-06-08 01:29\ntemplate: solution\npublish: ghx\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"Free Wheelchair Mission is a faith-based charitable organization aimed at providing a safe and well-designed solution for those with physical disabilities around the world.

In addition to wall recharging ability, you can power it yourself using the trusted Freeplay self-charge technology, so you'll never run out of power.  That, combined with the reliability of ultra-bright white LEDs rated for 100,000 hours, makes the Indigo Lantern the most dependable lantern on the market.  With the peace of mind of never needing to ever replace batteries or bulbs, you'll know that your Indigo Lantern will work whenever you need it, anytime, anywhere.  Yet you'll have excellent brightness and shine time.\n\nIdeal for everyday and emergency use, indoors and out, the Indigo Lantern puts the power in your hands.  The self-charge system offers maximum dependability for those times when you can’t afford to be left in the dark by dead batteries.  A quick wind (about 60 seconds) provides up to 1 hour of light using the directional light – and you can wind again at any time for as much shine-time as you want.  An LED charge level indicator tells you the optimal winding speed.\n\nUsing the dimmer switch, the Indigo allows you to adjust the brightness of the lantern to your specific requirements, from maximum brightness to a night-light.  This also allows you to maximize your shine time:  the lower the brightness, the longer the shine.\n\nThe included reading light / flashlight is also an LED with excellent performance, delivering an hour of brilliant white light per 60-second wind.\n\nThe Indigo Lantern is rechargeable and, when fully charged, the lantern provides up to 8 hours of continuous ultra bright light, and 100 hours of night-light, using the LED cluster.  Similarly the directional light will shine for up to 40 hours continuously.\n\nThe rechargeable battery means that there is no use of disposable batteries that are harmful to the environment.  Not even for \"spare power\":  you are the spare power.\n\nInternal mechanical components are specified to industrial standards for repeated use and long life.  A handle swings up to let you to carry or hang the lantern as required, and the sturdy rubber feet allow for placement on uneven surfaces.\n\nWith the Freeplay Indigo Lantern, you’ve got light anytime, anywhere.\n\n","id":"81","name":"Freeplay Indigo LED Lantern","category":"energy","tags":"lighting","image":"ast/81-fp-ml1.png","video":"//player.vimeo.com/video/40666570","user_id":"304","created":"2010-07-19 16:58","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/freeplay-energy-indigo-led-lantern","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"It was whilst watching a BBC documentary in April 1994 when Chris Staines first realized the potential of an innovative idea from British inventor, Trevor Baylis. \"The Clockwork Radio\", as the device was first known, was proposed as a means of halting the spread of Aids in Africa through better education. Traditional radio, although widespread, relied on an electrical supply or the availability of disposable batteries - both of which were in short supply across the continent.Chris and his business partner, Rory Stear, immediately realised that the potential for self-sufficient electronics could go much further than radio and Africa.

FrontlineCloud makes life simpler with a quick set-up process, more ways to connect to mobile networks, and all of the sophisticated data management available through the cloud. It brings the convenience of the web to your text message communications, all for a low monthly rate.\n\nFrontlineCloud is a networked service that is hosted by FrontlineSMS for $10 per month.  Users can log into their account on the Frontline website from any computer and send messages online wherever there is internet access. The benefits of FrontlineCloud are speed and accessibility, as users can log in to their accounts from anywhere without bringing a modem and SIM card.\n\nMobile is everywhere. More than 3.5 billion people have mobile phones worldwide, and they send more than 22 billion SMS every day. Coordinating messages with the people you care about- staff, customers, fans or friends- can be challenging without the right set of tools. Mobile communications are increasingly fragmenting across different platforms, network operators, devices, and geography, making it more difficult to navigate using the world’s most accessible communication tool: SMS. FrontlineCloud allows a project in London to message farmers in Lusaka, or nurses in Kansas to text health workers in Karachi. Users can log in to send and receive SMS anywhere in the world at local prices, wherever they connect to the Internet. By combining the efficiencies, popularity and reach of SMS with the sophistication and billing structures of the web, FrontlineSMS and FrontlineCloud are tools for integrating mobile communication into multi-channel information management systems.\n\n\n","id":"496","name":"FrontlineCloud","category":"education","tags":"connectivity, mobile-and-desktop-applications-edu","image":"ast/496-cloudlogo.png","user_id":"754","created":"2014-04-15 14:07","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/social-impact-lab-foundation-frontlinecloud","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The Social Impact Lab Foundation worked to make Cloud as accessible as possible - the cost is as low as low as possible and only covers server hosting expenses.

As internet access becomes more and more widespread, the Social Impact Lab Foundation thinks its benefits should be democratized as much as possible. FrontlineCloud was built to straddle the worlds of Internet and SMS - you need an internet connection to administer the software, but you are still reaching your beneficiaries via SMS - delivering better, faster, cheaper information to people on whatever device they happen to have.  The communication platform - SMS - is still the same, FrontlineCloud is just a better and more economical way to deliver it.  Insofar as accessibility is a goal to strive for, FrontlineCloud overcomes common obstacles to connect people via SMS. Often times it is the case that those implementing the projects have a relatively stable internet connection, which they can leverage to send out more SMS and reach even more beneficiaries than would be possible with just the desktop version of FrontlineSMS.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/social-impact-lab-foundation-frontlinecloud#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): 1 to 20 USD  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/social-impact-lab-foundation-frontlinecloud#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: https://www.frontlinesms.com \nproducturl: https://www.frontlinesms.com/product \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"https://www.frontlinesms.com","producturl":"https://www.frontlinesms.com/product","_href":"/solutions/social-impact-lab-foundation-frontlinecloud#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Social Impact Lab Foundation\n\n","_txt":"Social Impact Lab Foundation  \nWashington, DC  \n20006  \nUnited States  \n+1 646 460 5853  \n[info@frontlinesms.com](mailto:info@frontlinesms.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Social Impact Lab Foundation","_href":"/solutions/social-impact-lab-foundation-frontlinecloud#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/social-impact-lab-foundation-frontlinesms ----\nid: 495\nname: FrontlineSMS\ncategory: education\ncategory: partners\ntags: connectivity, mobile-and-desktop-applications-edu\nimage: /ast/495-cloudlogo.png\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/FgtGbx-GKqo\nuser_id: 754\ncreated: 2014-04-15 13:48\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"FrontlineSMS is a desktop software created to lower barriers to positive social change using mobile technology.

This yaws the turbine at an angle to the prevailing wind at windspeeds above 35mph (15m/s) thus reducing the speed of the turbine and protecting it from the forces of excessive winds and reducing stresses on the turbine and tower.  This is a very simple but effective design perfected by us many years ago and subsequently emulated by others.\n\nThe Furlmatic FM910-4 Windcharger is a quiet, discreet windcharger that can replace the need to install grid power and even enable the use of appliances at remote locations previously considered unfeasible owing to high grid installation costs.

It further breaks down barriers between health facilities and community members.\n\nIndividuals with low incomes collect garbage from the streets and bring it to GCI. The waste is then weighed and separated and valued. The individual is then “paid” in the form of a medical health insurance. For as little as 0.66 Euro per month, an individual is given access to a range of services including healthcare, rehabilitative healthcare, basic free treatment, in-clinic counseling and laboratory checks.\n\nThe separated garbage is then sold onto waste companies and collectors; organic waste is used for animal feed, inorganic waste can be converted to upcycling products and then sold for a higher amount. By showing people how much their waste is worth, the scheme encourages communities to organize and create sustainable financing from their own resources. This, in turn, improves their access to medical treatment and the quality of public health program with respect to promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative wellbeing.

The Appliance weighs only 21 pounds / 9.5 kg and has a life span of more than 20 years.\n\nGLOBAL SUN OVENS® are designed to be as energy efficient as possible, maximising energy to achieve the highest possible temperature and retain highest amount of heat possible, while minimizing weight and negative impacts on the environment. The annual wood consumption for cooking throughout developing countries is 1,000 pounds of wood per person. A family of six using a GLOBAL SUN OVEN® for 80% of their cooking needs would save 4,800 pounds of wood per year, and prevent over 88 tons of CO2 emissions tbeing released into the earth's atmosphere, over the oven's 20 year lifespan. \n\nOther than cleaning, no other ongoing maintenance is required.\n\nDue to their durability, ability to be used when there is less sun and the fact that food can be cooked faster, means the GLOBAL SUN OVEN® are less expensive on a cost per meal basis than other solar cooking devices. The high quality materials that are required to make a GLOBAL SUN OVEN® make its initial cost higher but its overall cost lower than any other solar cooking device. In areas where people can not afford to purchase an oven outright micro-finance programs are utilized to allow ovens to be paid in small installments using money that would have otherwise been spent purchasing charcoal.\n\nThe price of GLOBAL SUN OVEN® can be reduced by assembling them in the countries in which they will be used. SUN OVENS International has developed a local assembly plant system, enabling GLOBAL SUN OVEN® to be made in the area they will be used, dramatically reducing the cost of the ovens and shipping.

This gives the grains a golden color, as opposed to regular white rice, which is practically devoid of carotenoids. When the rice is consumed, the β-carotene is either stored in the fatty tissues of the body or converted into vitamin A.  People living on a poor diet are at risk of becoming vitamin A deficient, which can lead to life-threatening illnesses.\n\nRice produces β-carotene in the leaves but not in the grain, where the biosynthetic pathway is turned off during plant development. In Golden Rice, two genes have been inserted into the rice genome through genetic engineering, to restart the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway leading to the production and accumulation of β-carotene in the grains. Both genes are naturally involved in carotene biosynthesis. The difference here is that the reconstructed pathway is not subject to down regulation, as usually happens in the grain.\n\nThe intensity of the golden color is a visual indicator of the concentration of β-carotene in the endosperm. The goal is to make sure that people living in rice-based societies get a full complement of provitamin A from their traditional diets. This would apply to countries such as India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Golden Rice could still be a valuable complement to children's diets in many countries by contributing to the reduction of clinical and sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency-related diseases.\n\n\n","id":"636","name":"Golden Rice","category":["medical","partners"],"type":"product","tags":["100-under-100","nutrition"],"image":"ast/636-goldenrice.jpg","user_id":"922","created":"2015-03-05 18:46","template":"solution","_href":"/solutions/golden-rice-humanitarian-board","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Golden Rice was invented by Ingo Potrykus, Professor emeritus of the Institute for Plant Sciences of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and Professor Peter Beyer, of the Centre for Applied Biosciences, University of Freiburg, Germany.

There, Ingo Potrykus and Peter Beyer met for the first time, and subsequently decided to embark on the project that would lead to the development of Golden Rice in 1999. Their great contribution consisted of showing that a very complex biosynthetic pathway could be tweaked to enhance the health-promoting virtues of a crop. The breakthrough insight was that most of the pathway was already present in the rice grain and it only needed two genes to reset the entire pathway.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/golden-rice-humanitarian-board#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/golden-rice-humanitarian-board#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.goldenrice.org/index.php  \nproducturl: http://www.goldenrice.org/index.php  \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.goldenrice.org/index.php","producturl":"http://www.goldenrice.org/index.php","_href":"/solutions/golden-rice-humanitarian-board#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Golden Rice Humanitarian Board\n\n","_txt":"Golden Rice Humanitarian Board  \nZurich  \nSwitzerland  \n[contact@goldenrice.org](mailto:contact@goldenrice.org?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Golden Rice Humanitarian Board","_href":"/solutions/golden-rice-humanitarian-board#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/green-vitality-solution-industries-graminheet-natural-draft-biomass-cook-stove ----\nid: 1qvsmct6\nname: Graminheet Natural Draft Biomass Cook Stove \ncategory: energy\nimage: /ast/1qvsmct6-slide9.png\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6_tOWkjFLM\ncreated: 2019-05-04 08:03\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"Graminheet Natural Draft Biomass Cook Stove aims to: \n1.Minimize fuel usage\n2.Reduce the smoke emission\n3.Use different biomass fuels\n4.Accepts different cooking vessels\n\n\n\n","id":"1qvsmct6","name":"Graminheet Natural Draft Biomass Cook Stove","category":"energy","image":"ast/1qvsmct6-slide9.png","video":"//www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6_tOWkjFLM","created":"2019-05-04 08:03","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/green-vitality-solution-industries-graminheet-natural-draft-biomass-cook-stove","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"WHY Smokeless Unnat CHULHA?\n1.

The design is based on easily-sourced and inexpensive components, and the control software is encapsulated in a dedicated micro-controller which favours the deployment of HEV in areas with limited resources and unstable power distribution. The design is modular and adaptable to a wide range of needs and geographic deployment. HEV was designed to be easily be modified and repaired, with implementation depending on local requirements.\n\nHEV targets pressure controlled modes: PC–A/C (pressure  assist), PC–A/C–PRVC (pressure regulated volume control), PC-PSV (pressure support ventilation), and CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure). PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) also provides steady low positive pressure to the lungs to avoid alveolar collapse. The PC–A/C–PRVC option provides a set tidal volume at the lowest possible airway pressure. If the target tidal volume is not achieved, the pressure can then be gradually adjusted to achieve the set volume. All modes allow the patient, when capable, to take spontaneous breaths, and assist spontaneous breath intake, excluding CPAP.\n\nThe pressure controlled modes outlined above are prioritised in view of their importance for COVID-19 treatment. The pneumatic concept of HEV is based on ventilation via a pressure buffer, allowing a precise and safe pressure control and accurate monitoring of flow rates. The step-down pressure design via the buffer embeds safety in the design. Clinical advice, as well as MHRA AAMI, and WHO guidelines, has guided the main ventilator choices, prioritising precise and stable pressure delivery, the simplification of ventilation modes, attention to the trigger timings, and a straightforward and familiar interface for clinicians. The design is low cost, rapid, and simple to construct, and the design choices prioritise low cost, readily commercially available components.\n\nSummary Specs:    \n* This is a pressure control device\n* Working Pressure: Up to 50 cm H2O.\n* PRVC peak pressure limit set to 35 cm H2O\n* PEEP available with a set range between 0 and 5 cm H2O\n* Minute volume flow capability: Up to 20 litres/min.\n* Inspiratory flow capability: Up to 120 litres/min.\n* Respiratory rate: 10–30 breaths/min.\n* Tidal volume setting to be provided in the range 250–800 ml in steps of 50 ml.\n* I/E ratio; 1:2 will be provided as standard, and the unit will be adjustable in the range 1:1–1:3.\n* Internal battery provides up to 45 minutes autonomy\n* Alarms and Display in line with MHRA specificaitons.\n\n\n\n\n","id":"26uq9r4m","name":"HEV ventilator","category":["medical","covid19"],"tags":"ventilator","image":"ast/26uq9r4m-hev.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/L11ty-yQ05Y","created":"2020-06-09 16:45","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/cern-hev-ventilator","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"HEV was born out of discussions in the LHCb VELO group, when lead-designer Jan Buytaert (CERN) realised that the systems which are routinely used to supply and control gas at desired temperatures and pressures in particle-physics detectors are well matched to the techniques required to build and operate a ventilator. The team started from a set of guidelines from the UK government’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency regarding rapidly manufactured ventilator systems, and was encouraged by a 3D-printed prototype constructed at the University of Liverpool in response to these guidelines. The driving pressure of ventilators — which must be able to handle situations of rapidly changing lung compliance, and potential collapse and consolidation — is a crucial factor for patient outcomes. The HEV team therefore aimed to produce a patient-safety-first design with a gentle and precise pressure control that is responsive to the needs of the patient, and which offers internationally recommended operation modes.\n\nThe first stage of prototyping, achieved at CERN on 27 March 2020, demonstrated that the HEV working principle is sound and allows the ventilator to operate within the required ranges of pressure and time. The desired physical characteristics of the pressure regulators, valves, and sensors are under refinement, and clinician support is being harnessed for further prototyping and deployment stages. This is a device which has patient safety as a major priority, and is aimed at deployment round the world, also in places that do not necessarily have state-of-the-art facilities.\n\n\n\n**THIS DEVICE IS NOT APPROVED FOR CLINICAL USE YET.**   \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/cern-hev-ventilator#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: Yes  \nCountries where available: provided under the Open Hardware License  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/cern-hev-ventilator#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 2x1x1 metres  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/cern-hev-ventilator#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: https://hev.web.cern.ch\nproducturl: https://hev.web.cern.ch/design\n\n","_txt":"[Documentation, article, or review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00534.pdf)  \n[Technical Specifiations (pdf)](/ast/hev.pdf)  \n\n\n","url":"https://hev.web.cern.ch","producturl":"https://hev.web.cern.ch/design","_href":"/solutions/cern-hev-ventilator#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: CERN\nurl: https://hev.web.cern.ch\n\n","_txt":"CERN  \nEsplanade des Particules 1  \nGeneva  \n1211 Geneva 23  \nSwitzerland  \n\n[fight-covid@cern.ch](mailto:fight-covid@cern.ch?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)\n\n","name":"CERN","url":"https://hev.web.cern.ch","_href":"/solutions/cern-hev-ventilator#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/wetlands-work-handypod ----\nid: 1dc9ebzr\nname: HandyPod\ncategory: water\nimage: /ast/1dc9ebzr-floating-household-handypod.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/VmRO6nPIIc8\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"The Handy Pod is a water treatment system designed to filter wastewater in floating communities using natural vegetation.

The Golden Minute identifies the steps that a birth attendant must take immediately after birth to evaluate the baby and stimulate breathing.\n\nThe HBB curriculum is designed to be used as part of a coordinated educational approach to early neonatal care and can be effectively combined with other curricula. It can be locally taught to birth attendants in diverse venues and locations. HBB focuses on practices that all persons who care for babies at birth can learn to care for healthy babies and/or assist babies who do not breathe on their own.\n\n","id":"377","name":"Helping Babies Breathe","category":"medical","type":"product","tags":"women-and-children","image":"ast/377-innovations-hbb.png","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/0VvoJzU00KM","user_id":"484","created":"2013-10-18 20:47","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/american-academy-of-pediatrics-helping-babies-breathe","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The WHO estimates that one million babies die each year from birth asphyxia (eg. inability to breathe immediately after delivery).

For rabies vaccine, the same or better protection can be achieved by delivering smaller amounts of vaccine intradermally (into the top layer of the skin), sparing valuable doses and stretching supplies to provide for more patients. Intradermal (ID) regimens for rabies vaccine have been adopted in many regions, protecting people who have been exposed to rabid animals, while saving costs and vaccine.\n\nThis approach is not yet universal, despite clear benefits, due in part to the difficulty of giving an ID injection correctly. The Mantoux technique, which uses a traditional needle and syringe for ID delivery, has historically been recognized as a difficult and inconsistently used technique. In many countries, only certain health care workers are able to perform ID injections, such as for rabies vaccine and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin or BCG, a vaccine given intradermally at birth to prevent tuberculosis. Smaller ID doses of other vaccines could also be effective. Such dose sparing could be particularly meaningful to immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries, as they could potentially reduce the amount of vaccine needed per patient, thereby cutting costs and overcoming vaccine shortages. However, concerns regarding the difficulty and a lack of reliability of conventional ID injections limit research in this field and introduction of this technique into immunization programs.\n\nThe intradermal adapter makes ID injections easier. It facilitates the procedure by standardizing injection depth and angle. It is anticipated that the ID adapter would expand the pool of health care workers capable of performing the procedure. This would have a particularly high impact in remote or underserved communities with more limited access to health care specialists.\n\n","id":"140","name":"Intradermal Adapter","category":"medical","type":"product","tags":"vaccination","image":"ast/140-id-adapter.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/CT6IA72mTZA","user_id":"328","created":"2011-02-26 07:35","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/path-intradermal-adapter","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"In partnership with SID Technologies of Newtown, Pennsylvania, PATH developed the ID adapter from the initial concept through manufacturing of clinic-ready devices.

Unfortunately, they fell out of favor with public health officials in the 1980s, after they were suspected of spreading hepatitis. The need for a needle-free technology remained.\n\nThe problem was that older injectors administered multiple doses of vaccine from a single vial. New injectors use disposable syringes—each containing a single dose of vaccine—that prevent the transmission of infection from one person to the next.\n\nPATH has worked with several jet injector companies over the years to advance “second-generation” jet injectors. Designed for use in developing-country clinics or large immunization campaigns, these jet injectors are hand-wound or spring-powered, generating a high pressure stream so that the vaccine penetrates the skin.

A treadle pump can be used by all members of a farming family to irrigate crops. The user stands on two treadles, usually made of bamboo, and pedals them. This light exercise, similar to using a step machine, operates two metal pump-cylinders which are connected to a tube-well, or to a surface level pond. The tube-well consists of robust, flexible plastic, sunk into the ground until it reaches an aquifer. Before first use, water is poured into the cylinders to ‘prime’ the pump. When the user pedals, water is lifted up onto the field, or into a pond or irrigation canal. The pedalling action is easily mastered and not strenuous, so that anyone in the family can take a turn at irrigating the fields. Typically the household will operate a pump for between two and eight hours per day, often in the early morning or evening when the weather is cool.\n\nDirect impacts of Treadle Pump irrigation\n\n - The income impact of the Treadle Pump technology varies across households and regions, but US$400 per year is the estimate of the average increase in the annual net income of each household\n\n- It frees the farmer from the limitations of rain fed farming and raises his capacity to grow crops in both winter and summer\n\n - Land augmenting : For the poor farmers constrained by the small size of the landholdings, treadle pump technology acts as a land augmenting intervention. With the use of Treadle Pump the farmers can cultivate all the year round thus increasing their cropping intensity to 200-300%.\n\n - Easy and productive : The Treadle pump is easier to use and is more productive than a variety of traditional manual irrigation devices. Its output is in the range of 4000-4500 litres/hour with a lift of 4-7 m.\n\n- Change in cropping pattern : Treadle Pump technology enables the farmers to grow crops they were not able to grow earlier, example- farmers are able to grow vegetables and make more money by selling them\n\n- The most significant impact is the increase in the crop yield\n\n- Among the most important reason cited by farmers themselves is the leaching away of the fertilizers due to the strong water currents generated by the diesel pumps (traditionally used by farmers for irrigation during non-monsoon seasons)\n\n - Farming families have a better diet with more vegetables and milk, and plenty of surplus produce to sell\n\n- Acumen Fund survey showed that helping with pumping did not add to chores of children or prevent them attending school\n\n- TUV Nord has verified greenhouse gas savings from avoided diesel as 0.477 tonnes/year CO2 per pump.\n\n\n","id":"67","name":"KB Treadle Pump","category":["agriculture","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","irrigation"],"image":"ast/67-ide-india-treadle-pump.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/D1d32uVHZtc","user_id":"118","created":"2010-02-09 11:36","template":"solution","publish":"tel","feature":"tel","_href":"/solutions/international-development-enterprises-india-idei-kb-treadle-pump","#summary":{"_hdr":"---- #summary ----\n\n","_txt":"IDEI has designed an irrigation solution that is both easy to use and versatile.

Nadia was clearly a very bright girl, so I made a deal with her. I'd remotely tutor her for an hour after work as long as she was willing to do any extra work I gave her.\n\nI began remotely tutoring Nadia in August of 2004. She was in New Orleans--where I also grew up-- so we used a telephone to talk and Yahoo Doodle as a shared notepad. Nadia ended up catching up and getting ahead of her class so I started tutoring her brothers, Arman and Ali, as well. Eventually, word got around and I was remotely tutoring and handful of cousins and family friends. Scheduling around my work, their soccer practice, and the different time zones became a little ridiculous, so I started to make YouTube videos for them to watch in their own time, at their own pace.\n\nIt didn't take long to see that other students (including adult learners) were hungry for videos like these so I kept going!\n\nEven before I made the videos, I started writing simple Javascript problem generators so that my cousins would never run out of practice problems. I wanted to know when and how they were doing the problems, so I added a database to track usage. 70 modules and 10,000 lines of code later (much of which has made the software adaptive), it has morphed into the adaptive assessment exercises on our site.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/khan-academy#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Free  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/khan-academy#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nproducturl: http://www.khanacademy.org/  \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","producturl":"http://www.khanacademy.org/","_href":"/solutions/khan-academy#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Khan Academy\n\n","_txt":"Salman Khan  \nKhan Academy  \nMountain View, CA  \n94042  \n[info@khanacademy.org](mailto:info@khanacademy.org?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Khan Academy","_href":"/solutions/khan-academy#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/syngenta-foundation-for-sustainable-agriculture-kilimo-salama ----\nid: 678\nname: Kilimo Salama\ncategory: agriculture\ncategory: other\ntags: financial-tools\nimage: /ast/678-678-weather-station-5-opt.jpeg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/vzhF56_RMVQ\nuser_id: 922\ncreated: 2015-03-24 17:50\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"Kilimo Salama (Safe Agriculture) offers micro-insurance designed for Kenyan farmers so that they can insure their farm inputs against drought and excess rain.

All Lazarian building designs have a 20-25 R-Value and an Economic Life of 40-50 years. The wall systems of the homes comprise Lazarian polystyrene (EPS) foam blocks, concrete and steel rebar, a sustainable solution to cost effective, energy efficient housing for the needy. When the economic life of the Lazarian home is complete, approximately 90% of the home may be recycled, including the Lazarian EPS foam blocks, concrete, rebar, metal roofing, and wood. In places where use of wood is not available or desirable, roof truss systems may be built with recyclable steel angle iron or aluminum. Lazarian World Homes are simple and inexpensive to build. With minimum training, families are able to build their own homes. On-site Instruction is provided by Lazarian staff. Because the walls of a completed Lazarian home have cells filled with concrete and steel reinforcing bar, the resulting structure inside the walls of a Lazarian building is commonly referred to as Reinforced Concrete Post and Beam Construction. This is one of the strongest methods of construction known to structural engineers. Lazarian homes will withstand major earthquakes, storms and natural disasters. The walls are waterproof and are easily cleaned after a flood. The blocks also contain a fire retardant and pest repellant.\n\n","id":"298","name":"Lazarian World Homes","category":"housing","tags":"housing-and-shelter","image":"ast/298-lazarian.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/3JZe3Vt9qLU","user_id":"516","created":"2013-03-25 21:46","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/lazarian-world-homes","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Buildings have been erected in California, Haiti, Mexico, Honduras, Brazil.

While many of the highly potent drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS and TB are toxic to the liver, deaths due to drug-induced liver failure are very rare in countries like the United States, where a patient’s liver function is monitored regularly. Yet this is not the case in resource-poor countries, where roughly 20% of TB patients and 25% of HIV/AIDS patients, lacking access to diagnostic tools, succumb to liver complications related to their treatment.\n\nDesigned specifically for use in the developing world, DFA’s device will enable semi-quantitative determination of two key liver enzymes, AST (aspartate transaminase) and ALT (alanine transaminase), which are routinely used to measure liver toxicity amongst patients receiving antiretroviral medications. As the liver becomes damaged by potent medications, these two enzymes, usually found in the liver, are released into the blood stream. From a single drop of whole blood, this test will determine whether blood levels of these two enzymes are baseline/normal, greater than two-times baseline/normal, or greater than five-times baseline/normal. The 2x and 5x thresholds, which indicate that treatments should be “monitored closely” or “altered immediately”, correspond to protocols established by the U.S. FDA to guide treatment during clinical trials.\n\nThe liver function test is targeted to cost $0.10 or less, will be about the size of a postage stamp, and will function without external power or equipment. The output will be a straightforward, semi-quantitative colorimetric indication of enzyme levels and will be easily integrated into telemedicine networks.\n\n","id":"172","name":"Liver Function Test","category":"medical","type":"product","tags":"medical-and-surgical, medical-devices","image":"ast/172-capture.png","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/BX-1AMSm6KU","user_id":"360","created":"2011-10-16 05:12","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/diagnostics-for-all-liver-function-test","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Paper is significantly less expensive than other materials typically used in diagnostic devices and is compatible with a variety of existing diagnostic tests.

No auxiliary equipment, electricity, or laboratory facility is needed to use the device or process a sample. Results are quickly displayed, enabling immediate clinical decisions.\n\nMinimal training is required to use a DFA device. It is both user-friendly and minimally invasive. A sample from a finger prick is sufficient to yield results. No syringes are involved and neither clean water nor sample preparation is needed. Results are displayed in an easily understood manner, as through a colorimetric scale.\n\nBefore distribution, devices are packaged so that they are protected from the environment and provide adequate shelf life for transport and storage in the developing world.

Extending his work in Limpopo Province, South Africa, Dr. Smith conducted a human-health study of 100 HIV-positive individuals and established a ceramic filter factory operated by a group of local women potters in the Venda region of Limpopo Province.\n \nThis work led to the establishment of PureMadi, a non-profit foundation associated with the University of Virginia Alumni Association. Today, PureMadi continues its student-based economic development efforts through the creation of ceramic water filter factories. In 2009, having demonstrated the performance capabilities of ceramic and silver ions, Dr. Smith and his research team focused their efforts on a new and innovative point-of-use water treatment products. After three years of intensive research and development, tens of thousands of water analyses, and experiments spanning several years in rural South African and Tanzanian households, they developed the M-Drop.\n \nIn 2015, MadiDrop PBC was created as a public benefit company under the leadership of David Dusseau, a Charlottesville-based entrepreneur with experience in launching new ventures. Today, MadiDrop PBC is working to provide safe drinking water technologies to communities throughout the world.

These include low manufacturing costs, replacement parts that are readily available, local maintenance, and a carrying capacity of 2,000lbs. With the ability to power attachments like food processors and water pumps, the product can also pull small field implements such as planters and cultivators. Powering attachments and pulling implements, which others cannot, gives the machine a competitive edge on the the agricultural market.\n\nFurthermore, testing has shown fuel economies of 40 to 60mpg (18 to 26 km/l) for the 10hp diesel engine option under heavy to light loading. Every component on the vehicle can be found or made in developing countries.

For example, Cameroon has a mere 19 motor vehicles per 1000 people and 92% of the roadways are unpaved. The lack of motorized transportation and quality road infrastructure leads to significant losses. Farmers in particular are affected as there is poor connectivity to markets in rural areas, meaning that food can spoil before it reaches its destination. As significant portions of the population live in rural areas, they are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. With most farm work being done by hand with little to no agricultural mechanization, an affordable solution that can navigate difficult rural terrain is required.\n\nThe G110 is not only able to transport goods on poor roads where other motor vehicles can’t go, it can also deliver farm produce to markets in a timely and affordable way. This means farmers can save time and money. With the capacity of powering auxiliary equipment such as water pumps, generators, and food processors, users don’t have to buy separate powers source for such equipment. The G110 can be used as a mobile unit for powering them. Finally, the G110 can be used for some small-field operations such as cultivating and planting, harvesting, tilling and threshing thereby reducing the time and energy needed for such tasks.\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/mobile-agricultural-power-solutions-maps-agrover#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: Yes

The intent of the price is to allow a large economic group to afford proper housing for the first time.\n\nLivability: Implementing innovative and quality design can provide not only affordable housing, but also housing that improves the quality of life for the inhabitants. This includes providing safety, sanitation and comfort.\n\nSustainability: Without available infrastructure, 1K House has to harvest energy and treat waste in a self-sustained way.

It dawned on him a week later that, while I had the luxury of returning home to a stable electrical grid, the people of Burundi lived each and every day without that service. What presented an inconvenience for him presented an insurmountable roadblock to consistent communication outside of Burundian’s neighborhood.\n\nIn 2009 Henri paired up with a designer to fill that vital gap in energy availability. Together they came up with a blueprint that would offer the operator mobility, dependability, simplicity, and—most importantly—a low-cost means for him or her to generate an income. In 2010 Henri found an engineer to help me bring this idea to life. And so the Mobile Charging Kiosk (MKP) was born.\nThe device is a franchise business model, so we partner with local franchisee that supply our products and services to the end users at the base of the pyramid.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/african-renewable-energy-distributor-mobile-kiosk-platform#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Burundi, Rwanda  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: no  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/african-renewable-energy-distributor-mobile-kiosk-platform#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 6 feet  \nWeight: 40 pound  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/african-renewable-energy-distributor-mobile-kiosk-platform#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://a-r-e-d.com  \nproducturl: http://www.a-r-e-d.com/shiriki-hub/ \n  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.a-r-e-d.com/media/)  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://a-r-e-d.com","producturl":"http://www.a-r-e-d.com/shiriki-hub/","[Documentation, article, or review](http":"//www.a-r-e-d.com/media/)","_href":"/solutions/african-renewable-energy-distributor-mobile-kiosk-platform#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: ARED\n\n","_txt":"Henri Nyakarundi  \nAfrican Renewable Energy Distributor  \nKigali  \nRwanda  \n250787666436  \n[henri@a-r-e-d.com](mailto:henri@a-r-e-d.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"ARED","_href":"/solutions/african-renewable-energy-distributor-mobile-kiosk-platform#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/pan-american-health-organization-modeling-to-improve-policy-decisions-in-the-americas ----\nid: hq43ch3\nname: Modeling to Improve Policy Decisions in the Americas\ncategory: medical\ntype: product\nimage: /ast/hq43ch3-screen-shot-2016-03-22-at-2.47.05-pm.png\ncreated: 2016-03-22 14:51\ntemplate: solution\npublish: ghx\ntype: publication\ntype: policy\ntags:  ncds, promotion-and-prevention, paho\n\n","_txt":"This publication, \"Applying Modeling to Improve Health and Economic Policy Decisions in the Americas: The Case of Noncommunicable Diseases\" is the first to exclusively present different economic models to illustrate their application to NCDs in the Region of the Americas.

These crops include maize, sorghum, barley, and rice. The Thresher aims to improve quality of life, strengthen value chains, and contribute to food security. This is done by producing a cleaner agricultural product that can be used more efficiently, thereby reducing the amount of hard labor and drudgery.\n\nDesigned for portability in the field and around rural settings, it is equipped with two wheels. It also has an indented seat so that it easily fits onto the back of a motorcycle rack, the preferred way of travel for many people in village areas. Aimed at farmers, this machine has the capacity to thresh different crops, allowing the farmer improved flexibility, and saving a great deal of time and labor.\n\nThe Multi-Crop Thresher is a throw-in type thresher. This means that crops are fed into the machine from the top. Once they enter the threshing chamber, a rotating drum beats the grains off of the stalks. Large chaff passes through to the exit of the chamber and is expelled from the machine, while threshed grain falls through a sieve-like structure called a concave. A fan blows dust and small chaff from the threshed grain, which then leaves the machine through an exit chute to be collected in bags.\n\n\n","id":"sa69ler","name":"Multi-Crop Thresher","category":["agriculture","partners"],"tags":["productivity-tools","empowering-people"],"image":"ast/sa69ler-csm-01-multicrop-tresher-b4dd52b5fd.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/5Dr1ptkK7I8","created":"2016-12-13 13:24","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/imara-tech-multi-crop-thresher","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"\nAgriculture accounts for over a quarter of the gross domestic product in Tanzania, but many farmers are still dependent on traditional farming methods. Activities such as threshing are time consuming and laborious: on average it can take up to three hours of hitting bundles of rice against a rock to produce 100 kg of threshed rice, and three hours of beating dried maize with a stick to produce 100 kg of shelled maize. Farmers could spend this time and energy more productively elsewhere.\n\nAlthough mechanized threshers drastically reduce the time spent threshing, they are conventionally expensive, bulky and not very user-friendly. The company has worked closely with Tanzanian smallholder farmers to design a context-appropriate multi-crop thresher (MCT) that provides the benefits of mechanized threshing while addressing its common drawbacks.\n\nUse of this Thresher also aims to create employment and entrepreneurship opportunities in modern agricultural services by creating a technological alternative to traditional post-harvest processing. Additional benefits can include increased incomes, and time for other productive activities. This will more often than not impact women, who are commonly responsible for post-harvest processing, as well as men seeking employment in modernized agricultural services. In all target groups include small farming households, women on small land-holder farms and entrepreneurs.\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/imara-tech-multi-crop-thresher#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: Yes  \nCountries where available: Tanzania  \nPrice range: Over 200 USD  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: No  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/imara-tech-multi-crop-thresher#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl:https://www.imaratech.co/  \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n","url":"https://www.imaratech.co/","_href":"/solutions/imara-tech-multi-crop-thresher#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Imara Technology Company Ltd.\n\n","_txt":"url: https://www.imaratech.co/\n \nImara Tech  \nTanzania  \n+255 752 750 122\n[info@imaratech.co](mailto:info@imaratech.co?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org) \n\n","name":"Imara Technology Company Ltd.","_href":"/solutions/imara-tech-multi-crop-thresher#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/my-safe-travel ----\nid: sa95dka\nname: Mysafetravel\ncategory: education\ncategory: housing\ntags: mobile-and-desktop-applications-edu\ntags: transportation\nimage: /ast/sa95dka-csm-01-safe-travel-6a035f3d4f.png\ncreated: 2016-12-13 14:45\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"\nTo be used specifically for private use, not commercial, Mysafetravel provides free access to the latest information from global travel security experts that will help you and your family stay more vigilant when travelling.

In areas where books are scarce but mobile networks are growing, the digital library serves the critical need for quality educational materials. The online library is filled with primary and secondary education content that is culturally relevant and available in local and international languages.\n\nIn every country, the e-book collection is reviewed and organized by an in-country advisory board. The platform is designed specifically for low-bandwidth environments, and is accessible on a full range of low-cost devices, including tablets and mobile phones. Reading can be done offline, and data on usage is collected through the platform when online. The library is flexible and scalable, and most importantly, responsive to the needs of educators and children in developing countries. The organization does not provide hardware, but rather identifies existing in-country devices and then customizes the platform accordingly. As the solution can be used on devices already found in the developing world, including low-cost tablets and mobile phones, Nabu.org is both inexpensive and highly scalable.\n\nContent is delivered from donations from international and local publishers, NGOs, governments or local stakeholders. Nabu.org has collaborated with leading distributors to deliver publisher content to readers in a secure, automated fashion. The library tool protects IP through a digital rights management (DRM) system, so international publishers can distribute their content freely on the Library without fear of piracy.

Sow six kernels of corn an inch deep and about ten inches apart in a circle of about two feet in diameter.\n - When the corn is about five inches tall, plant four bean seeds, evenly spaced, around each stalk.

Birth asphyxia/trauma—the condition when a baby does not breathe at birth—is the third most common cause of newborn deaths, accounting for 23 percent of all fatalities. Limited data suggest that deaths due to birth asphyxia have remained relatively unchanged in developing countries. The key to reducing these deaths is the provision of appropriate care to underserved populations during delivery. Approximately 50 million women give birth without a skilled attendant, 99 percent of whom live in low-income countries. Appropriate care for birth asphyxia requires that neonatal resuscitation skills and appropriate technology should be available to all skilled birth attendants and to community-level workers where skilled attendants are not available.\n\nEffective neonatal resuscitation equipment is needed by all birth attendants in order to reduce the danger of birth asphyxiation. Neonatal resuscitator technologies that are affordable and easy to use, clean, and store could increase the use of such lifesaving devices in the developing world. While currently available neonatal resuscitation devices are available in both bag and mask designs and tube and mask designs, their accessibility is limited in some world regions due to poor availability and affordability.

PATH then conducted an assessment of the performance and functionality, safety during use and reuse, ease of assembly and disassembly, and device construction of many devices.

During preparation of foods such as rice, porridge, meat, soup or vegetables, the content of the pot is usually heated to boiling point and then allowed to stew or simmer on the stove for a considerably long time, using up fuel to do so. However, once boiling temperature is reached, the temperature within the pot does not actually rise beyond that. Instead, the energy wasted is used just to offset the heat lost (through evaporation, conduction, convection) in order to maintain the cooking pot at a sufficiently high temperature.\n\nThe present invention's aim is achieved by the following method: Beneath the metal bottom of the \"daily thermal insulated energy-saving cooking utensil\", a disc-shaped heat reservoir is installed, which is made of a special refractory material with excellent heat storage performance. When the utensil is placed on the stove being heated, the disc-shaped heat reservoir located beneath the utensil's bottom is heated up and starts to store heat energy, as the food in the utensil is heated up to boiling point, the heat reservoir has already stored a significant quantity of heat energy. Now the utensil can be taken away from the cooking stove and put on the thermal insulated base, the heat reservoir beneath the utensil's bottom will release its stored heat energy slowly. In the first tens of minutes, the pot can be maintained at boiling point temperature, while afterwards it can be maintained above 85℃ for several hours.\n\n\nTherefore, by means of the above-mentioned design, this invention has achieved its aim through successfully appending the heat-regenerative performance to the \"daily thermal insulated energy-saving cooking utensil\" and thus making it has the special function to continuously heat up and turn raw or deficiently cooked food into thoroughly cooked food after the cooking utensil has been taken off from the cooking stove.\n\n","id":"508","name":"Off-Fire Reboiling Pot","category":"energy","tags":"clean-cookstoves","image":"ast/508-ofrpot.jpg","user_id":"793","created":"2014-06-21 03:30","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/other-off-fire-reboiling-pot","#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: China and some Asian countries   \nPrice range (USD): 20 to 50 USD  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: Yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: No  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/other-off-fire-reboiling-pot#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.mhzzhg.com/index.htm  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.mhzzhg.com/index.htm","_href":"/solutions/other-off-fire-reboiling-pot#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\n\n","_txt":"\nZhiliang Wan  \nShanghai  \nChina  \n[Contact](http://www.mhzzhg.com/msgBoard/msgPosten.asp)  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/other-off-fire-reboiling-pot#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/sumitomo-chemical-olyset-net ----\nid: 89\nname: Olyset Net\ncategory: medical\ntype: product\ncategory: partners\ntags:     100-under-100\ntags: vaccination\nimage: /ast/89-olyset.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/dDQ6zRbFEoA?list=UUIgP1suMqM64lPvwxj2BfUQ\nuser_id: 307\ncreated: 2010-07-25 22:30\ntemplate: solution\npublish: ghx\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"Traditional mosquito nets require regular dipping in insecticide to maintain effectiveness in repelling mosquitoes, as insecticide is dislodged during regular use and washing. There are also practical problems in re-treating nets in remote areas, a long way from the urban centres where stocks of insecticide and trained advisors are located.\n\nSumitomo Chemical engineers set about developing the first net that does not need this constant re-treatment. The process begins with insecticide-impregnated beads, which are extruded into fiber and warped onto bobbins to be knitted into rolls of netting.\n\nThe netting rolls are cut into sized panels which are machine-stitched into the nets themselves. Chemical and physical checks are made before the nets are sent for delivery by land, sea and air. Because the insecticide is incorporated within the fibers, Olyset Nets are truly ready-to-use, long-lasting and never in need of treatment. Washing does not diminish their effectiveness, and they have been shown to still repel mosquitoes seven years after initially being put into use.\n\nKey features:\n\n-Guaranteed to last at least five years. Research indicates that a seven-year life is often achievable.\n-Tough – Olyset Net uses polyethylene technology that makes the net stronger and more tear resistant than polyester nets.\n-Controlled release technology – unlike polyester nets, the insecticide in Olyset Net is contained within the fibre, not coated on the outside. This technology provides a slow release of the active ingredient which continues to control mosquitoes for more than five years.\n-Quadruple insecticide effect on mosquitoes – bite inhibition, repellency, knockdown, kill. All contribute to protection from biting mosquitoes and other insects.\n\n","id":"89","name":"Olyset Net","category":["medical","partners"],"type":"product","tags":["100-under-100","vaccination"],"image":"ast/89-olyset.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/dDQ6zRbFEoA?list=UUIgP1suMqM64lPvwxj2BfUQ","user_id":"307","created":"2010-07-25 22:30","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/sumitomo-chemical-olyset-net","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Sumitomo Chemical pioneered a technology to develop a net that effectively prevents mosquito biting, lasts for a long time and resists both washing and tearing. Olyset Net incorporates the insecticide permethrin into the actual fibers of the net, and releases it slowly over a number of years.\n\nOlyset Net passed the rigorous testing procedure known as WHOPES (World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme). This involved extensive laboratory and field studies held under scientific scrutiny, and a commitment to quality assurance through the publication of agreed specifications. Olyset Net was the first LLIN to pass WHOPES and earn WHO’s recommendation.\n\nOlyset Net is a crucial tool in the fight against malaria - and was the first WHO-recommended LLIN to be manufactured in Africa, where a child dies from malaria every 30 seconds. Production in Africa began in 2003 when Sumitomo Chemical provided a royalty-free technology license to A to Z Textile Mills in Arusha, Tanzania. Tanzanian production was further expanded in 2008 when Sumitomo Chemical celebrated the official opening of a 50:50 joint venture factory, expanding our partnership with A to Z in East Africa. In 2009, Olyset Net production capacity in Arusha will exceed 29 million nets a year -- more than half of the global Olyset Net output.\n\nIn June 2009, Sumitomo Chemical opened an Olyset Net stitching factory in Kombolcha, Ethiopia, which will produce 3 million Olyset Nets in its first year of operation. Read more.\n\nOlyset Net is a part of Sumitomo Chemical's corporate social responsibility program, and our commitment to helping the people of Africa is recognized internationally. Olyset Net production in Tanzania employs more than 5,000 people, and supports over 25,000 people in the vicinity of the factories. Additional local sewing facilities are currently planned in Malawi and Uganda.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/sumitomo-chemical-olyset-net#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nAvailable online: yes  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/sumitomo-chemical-olyset-net#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.sumitomo-chem.co.jp/english/  \nproducturl: http://sumivector.com/mosquito-nets/olyset-net  \n  \n[Documentation, article, or review](http://sumivector.com/sites/default/files/site-content/pdf/OlysetNet_Technical_Brochure_Jan_2013_ENG.pdf)  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.sumitomo-chem.co.jp/english/","producturl":"http://sumivector.com/mosquito-nets/olyset-net","[Documentation, article, or review](http":"//sumivector.com/sites/default/files/site-content/pdf/OlysetNet_Technical_Brochure_Jan_2013_ENG.pdf)","_href":"/solutions/sumitomo-chemical-olyset-net#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Sumitomo Chemical\n\n","_txt":"Sumitomo Chemical  \nTokyo  \n104-8260  \nJapan  \n+81-3-5543-5500  \n[info@olyset.net](mailto:info@olyset.net?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Sumitomo Chemical","_href":"/solutions/sumitomo-chemical-olyset-net#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/compatible-technology-international-omega-grinder ----\nid: 466\nname: Omega Grinder\ncategory: agriculture\ncategory: medical\ntype: product\ntags: productivity-tools, nutrition\nimage: /ast/466-omega.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/2aJi_PIr-as?list=UUpMazsY8fz2IH0FiLB0_Ugw\nuser_id: 395\ncreated: 2014-03-23 21:35\ntemplate: solution\npublish: ghx\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"The Omega Grinder is an affordable hand-operated burr mill that produces flour from grains and makes a creamy paste from roasted nuts.\n\nThe Omega Grinder is effective at making creamy peanut butter, cocoa butter, maize or millet flour and dozens of other products.

Qualitative and quantitative evaluations have demonstrated its acceptability and the effectiveness.\n\nTo further demonstrate the health the effects of kit use, PATH conducted the first cross-sectional study of single-use delivery kits in Africa. This major quantitative evaluation of the kit’s impact on preventing cord infection and puerperal sepsis in Tanzania was carried out in collaboration with the National Institute for Medical Research and the MOH. A total of 3,262 women were enrolled in the study, which was completed in late 2004. Results show that the kit has significant impact in reducing rates of infection. Newborns of mothers who used the clean delivery kit were about 13 times less likely to develop cord infection than infants whose mothers did not use the kit. Women who used the kit were about 3 times less likely to develop puerperal sepsis than women who did not use the kit. The study results suggest that making clean delivery kits available through government health clinics, markets, private pharmacies, or other commercial channels could likely help reduce rates of infection. PATH continues to seek opportunities to promote the use of clean delivery kits and integrate their use into larger maternal and child health programming around the world.

Clean hands. Wash hands with clean water and soap, once before delivery and once before cord cutting.\n2. Clean delivery surface. A plastic sheet for mothers to lie upon during delivery maintains a clean birth canal and perineum, and protects the newborn from potential sources of infection.\n3. Clean cord cut. A new razor blade in its original packing is sterile and can prevent the transmission of tetanus-causing spores and other pathogenic organisms via the umbilicus to the infant.\n4. Clean cord ties. Additionally, the use of clean thread or narrow tape to tightly tie the umbilicus helps keep the stump healthy.\n5. Clean cord stump care. Applying antiseptic such as chlorhexidine to the cord stump to prevent infection is the best care.\n\nWhere permitted by local regulations, PSI clean delivery kits may also include:\n\n- The antiseptic chlorhexidine for newborn skin washing and umbilical cord cleaning.

Vaccines can then be retrieved without jeopardizing the remaining vials and the insulated container can remain in the field for repeated use.\n\n","id":"471","name":"Passive Vaccine Storage Device","category":["medical","energy"],"type":"product","tags":"vaccination, cooling","image":"ast/471-p7-closed-stack-mg-5693-web.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/gSHEOa9jq0U?rel=0","user_id":"737","created":"2014-03-26 18:04","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/intellectual-ventures-lab-passive-vaccine-storage-device","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The Passive Vaccine Storage Device is still in the prototype testing stage.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/intellectual-ventures-lab-passive-vaccine-storage-device#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: no  \nCountries where available: Not yet commercially available.  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/intellectual-ventures-lab-passive-vaccine-storage-device#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://intellectualventureslab.com/?page_id=3793\nproducturl: https://www.intellectualventures.com/what-we-do/global-good-fund \ndocumentation, article, or review: https://www.intellectualventures.com/assets/landing_pages/globalgood/assets/files/Brochure%20-%20Medical%20Cold%20Chain%20Equipment.pdf\n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://intellectualventureslab.com/?page_id=3793","producturl":"https://www.intellectualventures.com/what-we-do/global-good-fund","documentation, article, or review":"https://www.intellectualventures.com/assets/landing_pages/globalgood/assets/files/Brochure%20-%20Medical%20Cold%20Chain%20Equipment.pdf","_href":"/solutions/intellectual-ventures-lab-passive-vaccine-storage-device#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Intellectual Ventures Lab\n\n","_txt":"Intellectual Ventures Lab  \nBellevue, WA  \n98005  \nUnited States  \n(425) 467-2300  \n[lab@intven.com](mailto:lab@intven.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Intellectual Ventures Lab","_href":"/solutions/intellectual-ventures-lab-passive-vaccine-storage-device#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/university-of-southampton-perso ----\nid: 25det24g\nname: PeRSo\ncategory: medical\ncategory: covid19\ntags: ppe\nimage: /ast/25det24g-perso-008.jpg-sia-jpg-fit-to-width-inline.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/56rqJGaYf8w\ncreated: 2020-05-03 09:12\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"**Information updated: May 3rd 2020**\n\nThis is an Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) hood.\n\nPersonal respirators use a fan to draw in air, through a filter, and deliver it to an enclosed hood or face mask.

Once a mosquito has been identified, a trained laser delivers photonic energy to kill or incapacitate it.  Designed for use in developing regions, the photonic fence will be used to complement bed nets, insecticides, and other existing vector control techniques.\n\nOne potential use of the Photonic Fence is to create a virtual fence that detects insects as they cross its plane. When an invading insect is detected, custom software is able to estimate the insect’s size and also to measure its wing beat frequency. Using this method, not only can the system distinguish between mosquitoes, butterflies, and bumblebees, but it can also determine whether a mosquito is male or female, as only female mosquitoes bite humans.\n\nOnce the software establishes that the insect is a valid target, it tracks the mosquito in flight, runs a safety check to ensure no innocent bystanders are in view, and then activates a laser to zap the mosquito. The Photonic Fence could be set along the perimeter of clinics or other strategic areas to control mosquitoes without endangering humans or other animals.\n\n","id":"469","name":"Photonic Fence","category":"medical","type":"product","tags":"vaccination","image":"ast/469-photonic-fence-web.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/U5Ex2ZIWWog?rel=0","user_id":"737","created":"2014-03-26 17:30","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/intellectual-ventures-lab-photonic-fence","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"A working prototype is still being tested, however in the future this solution will be beneficial for hospitals and clinics.

Station frequencies are displayed in a large, clear, easy-to-read format. A color-coded user interface, with only three buttons and one knob, makes it easy to understand for children and adults alike.\n\nThe Prime features a suite of power options – a solar panel, a hand crank, and a DC input which can be plugged into either a wall socket or a car battery. The solar panel, which slides onto the back of the radio, can charge the Prime directly through a cable, or removed and charged wirelessly. The wireless solar panel, an upgraded option, has a powerful, rechargeable battery pack, which provides additional battery capacity and extends playtime.\n\nThe upgraded solar panel also includes a USB output socket, enabling mobile phone charging on demand. There is an additional cost for this, but it will pay for itself in no time by charging phones. Given the lack of electricity in rural areas, charging mobile phones can be a challenge. This solar panel model comes with a USB lead and two standard charging port tips. Mobile charging by USB leads will become more common as phone manufacturers are now standardizing tips.\n\nWhen charging the Prime with the hand-crank in either direction, a green indicator light shines to let the user know that they are winding at optimum speed. If you wind it too slowly, now you’ll know to speed up.\n\nThe Prime’s powerful speaker makes it ideal for group listening in classrooms, marketplaces, or in community meetings. Radio distance education classes in countries like Malawi, Southern Sudan and Zambia can have more than 100 learners gathered around one radio. To cater for this, there is an auxiliary speaker output socket, allowing for additional speakers to be plugged in, boosting listening volume.\n\nThe Prime has an integrated LED light that is pushed to activate. It provides a bright light at night, or in unlit classrooms that can aid in reading or help teachers to grade papers.\n\n","id":"224","name":"Prime Radio","category":["education","energy","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","connectivity, energy-generation, devices"],"image":"ast/224-primeradio.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/qV8VQ05eo2c","user_id":"393","created":"2012-04-02 21:34","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/lifeline-energy-prime-radio","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Some of the team that brought you the Lifeline radio also designed and developed the Prime, under the direction of our new product development and trading arm, Lifeline Technologies Trading Ltd.

The pump may also be driven by an engine mounted PTO where a suitable PTO is available.\n\nThe pumps are sized to match the fuel consumption and to enable an additional volume to be pumped through the system, to allow multiple passes in order to gain as much heat transfer and oil filtration as possible.\n\n\n","id":"530","name":"RPS2000 Fuel Management System","category":"energy","tags":"energy-generation","image":"ast/530-rps2100-7.jpg","video":"/ast/530-rps-gep-50-canola-oil.wmv","user_id":"827","created":"2014-08-20 08:05","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/raw-power-systems-rps2000-fuel-management-system","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Early generation RPS Technology was first deployed in the maritime environment in Papua New Guinea in 2006-2007 on a RORO Ferry where 10,000 shp engines ran on palm olein.

The foil tank is placed in the ground and used to collect/capture up to 50 cubic meters of rainwater. From there the water is pumped up, purified when needed and distributed as drinking water to the consumers. Collected water can be stored for a period of up to 8 months dependant on level of maintenance.\n\nThe RainCap system is easy to transport, install and maintain. It can be installed in combination with the UV WaterBox. The tank can be cleaned regularly and removed when needed. The RainCAP system has a lifetime of ten years or more.\n\nTarget group and delivery:\nThe RainCAP is designed for usage in tropical countries with modest to high rainfall. Sizes are family level (with a 15 m3 tank) and village level (a 50 m3 tank). The tanks follow a modular design and can be linked dependent on the needs of the client. The 15 m3 tank serves an extended family of 30 people for 8 months consuming 2 liters per person per day. The 50 m3 tank serves a village of 200 people drinking 2 liters per person per day for 4 month.\n\nRainwater Catchment area:\nCapturing of rainwater is best done using existing roof systems. Schools, medical centers and governmental buildings can be often deployed for that purpose. By installing rainwater gutters along the roofs the water is collected. The RainCAP system is attached at that point to take care of the filtering, storage and purification of the water. The total of the collected rainfall is dependent on the condition of the roofs, the gutters and the level op maintenance in combination with the local rainfall pattern.\n\nLimitations:\nThe RainCAP system is best applied in tropical regions displaying moderate to high rainfall. The systems can be installed in relative soft ground (compacted sand, silts, etc.). It is advised to avoid sharp rocks surfaces in order to prevent puncturing of the foil material.\n\n","id":"305","name":"RainCAP System","category":"water","tags":"collection-storage-and-transport","image":"ast/305-raincap-concept-brochure-03.jpg","user_id":"484","created":"2013-04-11 19:54","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system","#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system#availability"},"#specifications":{"_hdr":"---- #specifications ----\n\n","_txt":"Dimensions: 15 or 50 cubic meter tanks available  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system#specifications"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.aaws.nl/ \nproducturl:  http://www.aaws.nl/rain-water-harvesting/\n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.aaws.nl/images/stories/bestanden_aaws/brochure_rainCAP_mail.pdf)  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.aaws.nl/","producturl":"http://www.aaws.nl/rain-water-harvesting/","[Documentation, article, or review](http":"//www.aaws.nl/images/stories/bestanden_aaws/brochure_rainCAP_mail.pdf)","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Aqua-Aero WaterSystems BV\n\n","_txt":"Aqua-Aero WaterSystems BV  \nCG Delft  \n2611  \nNetherlands  \n31 15 212 96 13  \n[info@aaws.nl](mailto:info@aaws.nl?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n\n\n","name":"Aqua-Aero WaterSystems BV","_href":"/solutions/aqua-aero-watersystems-raincap-system#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/rainsaucers ----\nid: 598\nname: RainSaucers\ncategory: water\ncategory: agriculture\ncategory: partners\ntags:     100-under-100\ntags: collection-storage-and-transport, irrigation\nimage: /ast/598-download.jpeg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/15XWKDtvmZ0\nuser_id: 922\ncreated: 2015-02-03 16:08\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"The RainSaucers™ system is a rain barrel accessory that allows users to harvest rainwater anywhere.

With 1.1 billion people living off-the-grid at the base of the pyramid, we knew that we needed to find a scalable solution. So we started the design process with need finding. We traveled across East Africa and Central Asia where we became inspired by the creative and innovative ways people accessed electricity but – at the same time – distraught by how unreliable and expensive these homegrown solutions were.\n\nWe saw a huge need that wasn’t being well-served. About 600 million people use cell phones even though they don’t have access to energy and even more people depend on burning kerosene for lighting, which can be dirty, dangerous and expensive. So we wanted to design a high quality battery that would charge mobile phones, lights and other devices, and would be powered by renewable energy, be sophisticated enough to meet people’s energy needs, be durable enough to withstand the environment, yet be simple and sleek in its design so everyone could use it.\n\nThat’s why we created the ReadyPay. We’re delivering this renewable energy system because we want to enable people to access the global economy through mobile technology, and to have clean, safe and affordable light. Inspired by how “mobile banking” revolutionized financial independence, we believe that “mobile energy” is the next exciting frontier.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/fenix-intl-readypay-solar-kit#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Uganda, United States and Canada\nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nAvailable online: yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Contact Fenix for details  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/fenix-intl-readypay-solar-kit#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://fenixintl.com/  \nproducturl: https://www.fenixintl.com/product/\n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://fenixintl.com/","producturl":"https://www.fenixintl.com/product/","_href":"/solutions/fenix-intl-readypay-solar-kit#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Fenix Intl\n\n","_txt":"Fenix Intl  \nSan Francisco  \n94107  \nUSA  \n[Contact](http://fenixintl.com/contact/)  \n","name":"Fenix Intl","_href":"/solutions/fenix-intl-readypay-solar-kit#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier ----\nid: 47\nname: Reverse Osmosis Water Purifier\ncategory: water\ntags: water-purification\nimage: /ast/47-rotech1.gif\nuser_id: 118\ncreated: 2010-01-29 18:38\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"Reverse Osmosis (RO), also known as hyper-filtration, is a purification process used in desalination plants to eliminate concentrated solutions like dissolved minerals and salts in water.  RO can be customised to address arsenic, nitrate, sulphate and other chemical contamination.\n\nRO technology uses a membrane that is semi-permeable, which allows only pure water to pass through it. During the process it rejects large contaminants passing through the membrane. Quality RO systems use a process known as ‘crossflow’ which allows the membrane to continually clean itself. RO requires a driving force to push the fluid through the membrane and as some of the fluid passes through, the rest continues downstream, thereby sweeping the rejected contaminants away from the membrane.\n\nThe unit that is skid-mounted and designed for indoor installation comprises a raw water pump that supplies water to the micron cartridge water filtration system and to the high pressure pump. Micron cartridge filters control the silt density before water enters into the membrane whereas high pressure pump exists to boost water pressure as required.\n\nAdvantages:- RO technology has a proven record to reduce/treat contamination related to fluoride/salinity and other chemicals.- It eliminates water from suspended solids, major inorganic pollutants like acids, salts, toxic metals and most of the organic micro pollutants including aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides and toxins.- The model has a throughput of 200 litres to 2,000 litres per hour and ensures quality safe drinking water for a village size of 2,000 to 10,000 population (the capacity can further go up).- Incurs low maintenance costs.- Easy to operate and maintain.\n\n\n\n","id":"47","name":"Reverse Osmosis Water Purifier","category":"water","tags":"water-purification","image":"ast/47-rotech1.gif","user_id":"118","created":"2010-01-29 18:38","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Tata Projects partnered with the Naandi Foundation,  a non profit organisation in India, to install RO technology in several villages in India providing clean drinking water to 400,000 villagers.\n\nMore information about this project can be found on the Naandi Foundation website:\nhttp://www.naandi.org/provide_drinking_water/makewatermore_2b.aspx\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: India  \nPrice range (USD): Contact supplier for quote  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: India  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.tataprojects.com  \nproducturl: http://www.naandi.org/naandi-community-water-services-ltd/\n[Documentation, article, or review](http://www.creativ-entrepreneur.com/?page_id=1858&lang=en)  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.tataprojects.com","producturl":"http://www.naandi.org/naandi-community-water-services-ltd/","[Documentation, article, or review](http":"//www.creativ-entrepreneur.com/?page_id=1858&lang=en)","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Tata Projects\n\n","_txt":"Dipankar Chatterjee  \nTata Projects  \nSECUNDERABAD  \n500003  \nIndia  \n+91 40 66 23 88 01  \n[dipankarc@tataprojects.com](mailto:dipankarc@tataprojects.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n\n\n","name":"Tata Projects","_href":"/solutions/tata-projects-reverse-osmosis-water-purifier#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/aprotec-river-ice-cooling-system ----\nid: 402\nname: River Ice - Cooling System\ncategory: energy\ncategory: partners\ntags:     empowering-people\ntags: cooling\nimage: /ast/402-csm-02-riverice-4a88c0aa7e.jpg\nuser_id: 484\ncreated: 2013-11-26 22:43\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"River Ice is a small-scale Garman river turbine directly connected to an open refrigeration compressor.

Each year, nearly 80 million women experience unintended pregnancies, about half of these end in abortion. Hundreds of millions of women annually suffer disability from pregnancy complications, and more than 500,000 die as a result of pregnancy, childbirth, or unsafe abortion. Almost all these deaths are preventable. Women also represent more than 50 percent of people living with AIDS; and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), excluding HIV/AIDS, are the second most important cause of loss of health in women, especially young women. Women want and need more female-initiated methods that can protect against pregnancy and STIs. Diaphragms could help meet this need, but some characteristics of traditional diaphragms limit their use and acceptability.\n\nPATH responded to the call for simple-to-use, female barrier protection by developing the SILCS Diaphragm, a single-size, reusable device with a contoured rim that allows the SILCS Diaphragm to fit most women with improved comfort. Design and development of the SILCS Diaphragm began in 1994, and user-centered evaluations of over 200 prototype designs refined performance and features. The single-size design will simplify the logistics of supply and provision. PATH used stakeholder assessments to ensure that comfort, ease of handling, and acceptability were built into the product. As a result, the SILCS Diaphragm directly addresses user and programmatic needs which will lead to improved access and acceptability. Acceptability studies among naïve users in South Africa and  Thailand found that women were able to learn to use the device easily and that women and men found the SILCS Diaphragm acceptable during use. In a comparative crossover study of the SILCS Diaphragm with a traditional diaphragm in the Dominican Republic, 19 of 20 women reported preferring the SILCS Diaphragm device after short-term use. Eventually, the single-size device could be provided over the counter or outside the clinic-based system where regulatory authority and clinical practice allow.\n\n","id":"148","name":"SILCS Diaphragm","category":"medical","type":"product","tags":"women-and-children","image":"ast/148-unit-silcs-land.jpg","user_id":"328","created":"2011-04-14 20:52","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/path-silcs-diaphragm","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The SILCS Diaphragm design was patented by PATH in 1998; a second patent on a spring modi cation has been  led.

During firing, the rice husk combusts, leaving behind many 0.6-500 μm holes that physically remove contaminants from the water.\n \nThe fired filters are then coated with silver nitrate, which acts as a biocide against the residual bacteria that may flow through.  The safe water storage reservoir prevents recontamination of treated water. With over 50 filter factories worldwide, ceramic water filters have been historically proven to be effective in removing 99.9% of microbiological contaminants.\n\nThe Purifaaya is our original product, designed for households and containing a capacity of 20 liters.\nThe Purifaaya XL, designed for institutions, contains 65 liters and includes a stand.

Fully-grown leaves are collected once a week, and three sacks can provide three to four meals per week for a family of five. 80% of the produce is consumed directly, while the surplus is sold to cover the cost of other expenses such as children’s education. Women's and youth groups have come together around this innovative and inexpensive technique which not only has a high impact, but is also easy to reproduce.\n\nAmongst the positive impacts of the project is the fact that the risk of people, particularly women, being harassed or attacked on their way to the market has decreased since residents are no longer obliged to buy vegetables late in the day.

Kenyan adolescent girls miss approximately 3.5 million learning days per month due to lack of funds to purchase sanitary pads. This impedes their ability to compete in the classroom, leads to low self-esteem, higher drop-out rates and, in many areas of Kenya, makes them vulnerable to early marriage.\n\nZanaA has found a long-term and holistic solution to this problem, which is to establish a sustainable business creating locally-produced, environmentally-safe sanitary pads in Kenya while advocating for greater policy support of girls.\n\nFirst, ZanaA plans to coordinate, on-line, the national distribution of sanitary pads, to ensure all vendors are distributing proper sanitary pads and with synchronized training in sanitary pad use and disposal as well as age-appropriate sexual maturation education.\n\nThis will help reduce the logistical burden of sanitary pad distribution, ensure sexual predators are not given entry to the school, distribute pads at the convenience of the school curriculum, enable equitable distribution across the country, and reduce the cost burden to donors. Along with this comes the development of a tool kit for enhancing policy around girls and education.\n\nSecond, ZanaA has become the exclusive distributor to the informal market (including school girls) for a sanitary pad invented by Dr. Musaazi of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, called MakaPads™, made from local, easily replenishable natural resources.\n\nMakaPads has been approved by the Ugandan Bureau of Standards, is in the final stage of registering with the Kenyan Bureau of Standards, and is pending international patent. This is the first of several solutions, to provide sanitary pad production opportunities using available natural resources.\n\nThird, ZanaA is interesting in networking with any producers of sanitary pads and any organizations who provide or who are planning to provide sanitary pads to schools because the world can handle many solutions for different contexts. We are particularly interested in leveraging agricultural waste.\n\n","id":"171","name":"Sanitary Pads For Africa","category":"medical","type":"product","tags":"women-and-children","image":"ast/171-img-2962-621x241.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/brLg5J0kPCY","user_id":"360","created":"2011-10-16 04:59","template":"solution","publish":["ghx","tel"],"_href":"/solutions/zana-africa-sanitary-pads-for","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Alongside product innovation, conversations have been started with networks of women’s groups regarding sales of pads to women at the bottom of the pyramid, and with NGOs to buy to distribute to school girls.

Our Founder, Tom Henderson OBE, saw the humanitarian response in most disasters was in the form of food and medicine. Little or no assistance was being given in terms of safe, secure shelter to help families survive the first days, weeks and months as they try to rebuild their lives. ShelterBox was created to fill this void. \n\nSince our inception in 2000, we have responded to earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, landslides, typhoons and conflict, delivering emergency humanitarian aid to families in need on every continent.\n\nThe ShelterBox solution in disaster response is as simple as it is effective. We deliver the essentials a family needs to survive in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Each large, green ShelterBox is tailored to a disaster but typically contains a disaster relief tent for an extended family, blankets, water storage and purification equipment, cooking utensils, a stove, a basic tool kit, a children’s activity pack and other vital items.\n\nWe rely on public donations and could not operate without the generosity of people the world over.

Traditional solar stoves are frequently designed only for cooking - leaving villagers reliant on solid fuels for heating - and are constructed with fragile concrete and glass components, yet rural communities lack the resources needed to repair broken devices. Moreover, many stoves weigh up to 95kg each. This excess weight hinders portability and in many cases prevents distribution networks from reaching the end-user.

Sunlight reaches the bottle, and is refracted by the water - which lights up a room inside as long as there is sunlight outside.\n\n","id":"157","name":"Solar Bottle Bulb","category":"energy","tags":"lighting","image":"ast/157-liter-of-light-2.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/o-Fpsw_yYPg","user_id":"306","created":"2011-09-07 01:57","template":"solution","publish":"tel","feature":"tel","_href":"/solutions/other-solar-bottle-bulb","#summary":{"_hdr":"---- #summary ----\n\n","_txt":"In places where there is little access to reliable electricity, there is still access to sunlight.

This means that you can partially unroll the panel and still utilize the power provided. Each segment produces an average of 50mA. To calculate the amount of power your panel will produce when partially unrolled, count the number of segments that you have rolled out and then multiply by 50mA. The voltage stays the same when rolled out entirely or partially.\n\nFully extended, the SolarRolls produce 900mA, 600mA, or 300mA, depending on wich SolarRoll you own. They can also be linked to other SolarRolls of the same wattage to double the current output. Due to the amount of current present, we recommend that no more than three panels be put in a series at one time.\n\nThe SolarRoll is waterproof and can be submerged all the way up to the electrical connectors and not be damaged. Avoid getting the electrical outlets wet. This could cause a direct short of the panel and may permanently damage your product. Use caution when using any electrical appliance.\n\n","id":"98","name":"SolarRolls","category":"energy","tags":"energy-generation","image":"ast/98-solarroll.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/QhtHDZTLgM8","user_id":"304","created":"2010-08-13 20:46","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/brunton-solarrolls","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Our drive and desire to pioneer a line of rugged power sources led to the introduction of the first flexible solar panel, the SolarRoll. Since then, the evolution of this concept has flourished. Backed by glowing reviews in every major magazine and newspaper in this country and others, the SolarRoll has officially taken its place as one of our most talked about products. The proof, though, is in the remarkable performance. The waterproof SolarRoll has given sea kayakers the power to photograph their voyages from the far reaches of the planet. And next spring, it will assist Ed Viesturs in his final summit, Annapurna, as he polishes off the last peak of Endeavor 8000. Ideal for powering satellite phones, members of expeditions worldwide pack the SolarRoll in place of expensive extra batteries that don't offer much relief in the form of weight. We realize however, that not everyone is defying the ordinary. Some of us simply need the SolarRoll for charging our car battery or running our video camera. With this in mind, we're offering alternative sizes and outputs this year to accommodate the growing demand for our most popular solar panel.\n\n","_href":"/solutions/brunton-solarrolls#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: USA, contact manufacturer for other countries  \nLocal Price: $295  \nAvailable online: yes  \nCountries where spare parts can be purchased: Contact manufacturer  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/brunton-solarrolls#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\n\n","_txt":"[solarrolls-manual.pdf](/ast/98-solarrolls-manual.pdf)  \n\n\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/brunton-solarrolls#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Brunton\n\n","_txt":"Brunton  \nRiverton, WY  \n82501  \nUSA  \n307.857.4700  \n[info@brunton.com](mailto:info@brunton.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Brunton","_href":"/solutions/brunton-solarrolls#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/solarturtle ----\nid: sa9m3e0\nname: SolarTurtle\ncategory: energy\ncategory: partners\ntags: empowering-people\ntags: energy-generation\nimage: /ast/sa9m3e0-csm-01-solar-turtle-bc0db22a5f.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/SvHtzwObA2o\ncreated: 2016-12-13 14:58\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"The SolarTurtle is a solar kiosk designed for maximum security and maximum portability.

The student designers at Innovations in International Health (IIH) have designed a solar powered autoclave, dubbed Solarclave, to circumvent this issue and promote safe and healthy practices in rural medicine. A series of mirrors reflects sunlight, concentrating rays of light onto a closed bucket which acts as a \"pressure cooker\". The heat generated inside is well over the required minimum for sterilization; any instruments placed inside the vessel will be sterile and ready for use. The Solarclave's unique design optimally traps the heat reflected by the mirrors, making effective use of materials and time.

A primary source of transmission of disease has been the reuse of contaminated needles and syringes. To be completely safe, single-use injection devices must be designed to automatically and irrevocably inactivate a\bfter a single cycle of filling and injection. The World Health Organization/Expanded Programme on Immunization (WHO/EPI) called for the design of such devices in 1987.\n\nIn response to WHO’s call, PATH designed one of the first feasible approaches to nonreusable syringes for immunizations: an autodisable (AD) syringe with a fixed needle that automatically locks a\bfter a single injection. When the syringe is filled to the preset 0.5-ml level, the plunger stops and cannot be pulled back further. A\bfter the vaccine is injected, the plunger automatically locks so that the syringe and needle cannot be reused. Known as the SoloShot syringe, this technology was licensed to and is now manufactured and marketed by BD, one of the world’s leading syringe manufacturers. Third-party field validations of the device in Pakistan in the early 1990s demonstrated the acceptability and usability of the design.

While a chlorine solution could provide a remedy, its availability, stability and correct dosing limits the application in such regions.\n\nThe SuMeWa|SYSTEM was developed to create a sustainable and cost effective solution to persistent problems of clean water access.\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/autarcon-sumewa-system#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: yes  \nCountries where available: Brazil, Ghana, Gambia, India, Pakistan, Laos, Egypt  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/autarcon-sumewa-system#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.autarcon.com/  \nproducturl: http://www.autarcon.com/index.php?id=12&L=2%252Findex.php%253Fid%253D%2527  \n  \n\n","_txt":"\n\n\n","url":"http://www.autarcon.com/","producturl":"http://www.autarcon.com/index.php?id=12&L=2%252Findex.php%253Fid%253D%2527","_href":"/solutions/autarcon-sumewa-system#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: AUTARCON\n\n","_txt":"AUTARCON  \nKassel  \n34117  \nGermany  \n+49 (0)561 - 506 186 890  \n[otter@autarcon.com](mailto:otter@autarcon.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"AUTARCON","_href":"/solutions/autarcon-sumewa-system#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/sughavazhvu ----\nid: 493\nname: SughaVazhvu\ncategory: medical\ntype: product\ntags: medical-and-surgical\nimage: /ast/493-sugva.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/kUxbMk39l5Y?rel=0\nuser_id: 737\ncreated: 2014-04-10 17:46\ntemplate: solution\npublish: ghx\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"SughaVazhvu Healthcare provides primary healthcare for rural Indian populations.\n\nWith a focus on accessibility, affordability and quality, Sughavazhvu has implemented the ICTPH model for providing primary healthcare to remote rural Indian populations through its rural primary healthcare network in the district of Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe organization trains healthcare workers to utilize protocol-based medicine.

It is based on an indigenous technology that can easily be constructed using local labor and materials. It also provides health benefits by allowing for the safe disposal of human excreta on-site, without requiring people to manually remove waste. It consists of a pan with a steep slope of 25°-28° and a specially-designed trap with a 20mm water seal. The toilet only requires 1-1.5 liters of water for flushing, thus helping to conserve water. \n\nThere are two pits of varying size and capacity depending on the number of users.  The capacity of each pit is normally designed for three years’ usage. Both pits are used alternately. When one pit is full, the incoming excreta is diverted into the second pit. In about two years, the sludge is digested and becomes almost dry and pathogen free, thus safe for handling as manure. Digested sludge is odorless and works as a manure and soil-conditioner. It can be dug out easily and used for agricultural purposes. The cost of emptying the pit can be met partially from the cost of manure made available. The Sulabh toilet can also be constructed on the upper floors of buildings. It has a high potential for up-gradation, and can later be easily connected to sewers when introduced in the area. Sulabh has so far constructed over one million individual household toilets in different parts of India.\n\nThere are twelve different models of the Sulabh Shauchalaya, which can serve a range of 5-10 people for 2-10 years  Models begin at 15 USD and can be constructed by local workers using locally-sourced materials.\n\n","id":"682","name":"Sulabh Shauchalayas","category":"water","tags":"sanitation","image":"ast/682-11227551-910560385672743-7666695004222655558-n.jpg","user_id":"922","created":"2015-04-02 14:17","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/sulabh-international-shauchalayas","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Sulabh International Social Service Organization, a non-profit voluntary social organization founded in 1970 by Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak, is dedicated to the Gandhian ideology of emancipation of 'scavengers', a section of Indian society condemned to clean and carry human excreta manually.

After setting up the water containers, the water slowly drips out of the containers through a tube, which can be attached to a water filter. This slow drip creates a slow shift in weight, so throughout the day, the solar panel changes position and tilts as the sun moves across the sky, and the water drips out of the containers. This makes the solar panel perpendicular to the sun all day as it moves from sunrise to sunset.\n\nAt the end of the day, when the sun is down, the water has completely dripped out of the containers and through the filter, creating clean water. As a result, the solar panel has harvested 30% more energy from the sun by remaining perpendicular to the sun all day.\n\n","id":"331","name":"SunSaluter","category":["energy","water","partners"],"tags":["empowering-people","100-under-100","lighting, water-purification, energy-generation"],"image":"ast/331-2uk40s2.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/pfM7KvisZSc","user_id":"561","created":"2013-06-14 21:38","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/sunsaluter","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Developed over the course of many years by Eden Full, the first SunSaluters were deployed to Kenya in 2010.

Using the energy-efficient LED technology, it allows for an affordable system, which is also modular and expandable according to the consumer's needs. Starting typically with one system consisting of a small solar panel connected to a Ulitium lamp, the system can be expanded by adding more panels and lamps as required. The configuration can be as large as the user desires, spanning across the entire home. A Lithium battery pack is housed inside each Ulitium lamp, thus eliminating the need for a centralized controller and tedious maintenance. Because the energy consumption of the Ulitium is very low, it does not require large solar panels, making the Sundaya Ulitium range the best choice for solar DC lighting in the years to come.\n\n\nMain features:\n\n1) 240 Lumen light output (equal to 7W CFL bulb or 40W incandescent bulb).\n\n2) 23% efficiency (compared to 1% for incandescent and 5% for CFL).\n\n3) Built-in Energy Storage (60kJ) and management electronics (no need for separate battery and controller anymore). Solar panel plugs in directly to the lamp through a Hub (which provides lightning surge protections).\n\n4) Dimmable from 240 Lumen, down to 120 Lumen, 25 Lumen, and off position, by integrated pull-switch.\n\n5) Extremely low energy consumption:\n    a. 8kJ/h @ 240Lm\n    b. 4kJ/h @ 120Lm\n    c. 1kJ/h @ 25Lm\n\n6) Long battery life:\n    a. 7,500h @ 8kJ/h (240Lm), equal to 3.4 years @ 6h/day\n    b. 15,000h @ 4kJ/h (120Lm), equal to 6.8 years @ 6h/day\n7) Extremely long life of light-chips:\n    a. 20,000h @ 240Lm, equal to 9 years @ 6h/day\n    b. 40,000h @ 240Lm, equal to 18 years @ 6h/day\n\n8) Can be charged with very small solar panel of 50kJ/day (3Wp):\n    a. 240Lm > 50kJ / 8kJ/h = 6h of light per day\n    b. 120Lm > 50kJ / 4kJ/h = 12h of light per day\n\n9) System expandable from 1 lamp to 10 or 100 lamps, simply by adding and connecting more panels and lamps.\n\n10) System can be added by a Sundaya LCD Color TV with same built-in Energy Storage technology.\n\n11) Automatic regulation of energy between devices that are connected to same PV panel (or array of panels). Devices that are used most will get the most recharging energy the next day.\n\n12) Can charge from any 18-24VDC source or any 32-36 cell PV solar panel with maximum Open Circuit Voltage of 25VDC (max).\n\n\n","id":"455","name":"Sundaya Ulitium 200","category":"energy","tags":"lighting","image":"ast/455-ulitium.jpg","video":"//player.vimeo.com/video/16012736","user_id":"484","created":"2014-03-06 20:33","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/sundaya-nordic-ulitium-200","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The above is history for only one third of the world’s population living in the modern world.

These methods include:\n- Teaching software\n- Multimedia presentations\n- Printed material\n\nThe project employs animated graphics and a voiceover to explain how individual alphabets combine to give structure and meaning to various words. The TCS course, which uses puppets as the motif in the teaching process, has been designed from material developed by the National Literacy Mission, established by the Indian government in 1988 with the aim of eradicating adult illiteracy in the country. The mission's lessons, which have been deeply researched and formulated, are tailored to fit different languages and even dialects.\n\nWith an emphasis on learning words rather than alphabets, the project addresses thought processes with the objective of teaching these words in as short a time span as possible.\n\n","id":"643","name":"Tata Literacy","category":["education","partners"],"tags":["100-under-100","teacher-and-student-resources"],"image":"ast/643-643-3032-tata-final-logo-opt.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/GQd44jlvoTI","user_id":"922","created":"2015-03-10 14:26","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/tata-consultancy-services-literacy","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Illiteracy is often synonymous with poverty.

Despite scarce rainfall, desert areas contain valuable building materials such as sand, wheat, straw, twigs and other organic materials. By using these readily available resources to construct greenhouses, construction and operational costs are minimized and organic cultivation is achieved. As a result, desert greenhouses produce social, economic and ecological benefits.\n\nGrooves are dug in the sand which hold tree bark, sawdust, poultry manure or oil cake mixed evenly with sandy soil. When fully fermented, this mixture creates a vegetative environment in which seedlings can be planted. The temperature in the desert greenhouse is usually between 15 and 25 degrees centigrade for most kinds of planted fruits and vegetables. The operational greenhouse in China shows positive results as eggplants, peppers, watermelons, tomatoes and other crops prosper.\n\nThe annual cost to maintain a greenhouse is around $3,200 USD.

The iron fish was made to defend against this ailment.\n\nThe fish, slightly acidified by lemon juice, only needs to be placed in the pot when water is boiling or cooking. The iron will be naturally released into the food or water that the villagers consume. This has halved the incidences of clinical anemia and increased the circulation of iron.\n\nLucky Iron Fish works with partners, big and small, around the globe to help distribute Fish and address iron deficiency among the world's poor.

Pumping is activated by stepping up and down on treadles which drive pistons, creating cylinder suction that draws groundwater to the surface. Treadle pumps free farmers from dependence on rain-fed irrigation, provide capacity to raise crops in two growing seasons per-year, and help farmers maximize return on their small plots of land. \n\nThere are three different models of iDE Treadle Pumps available: \n\n-The Portable Treadle Pump: Portable models have an inlet pipe that can be extended to surface water or down a well, and can be used for watering up to 1,500 square meters, and its portability allows it to be used for multiple fields.  Treadles, handles and the frame are generally made of steel, but they can be made of local materials (wood or bamboo), as well. \n\n-The Fixed Treadle Pump: The Fixed Treadle Pump is a foot-operated, low-cost option for accessing large quantities of water when the depth to water is less than seven meters. Fixed models are mounted on a well casing and use the casing pipe as the pump support.  Treadles, handles and the frame are generally made of local materials (wood or bamboo). \n\n-The Pressure Treadle Pump: These pumps are especially versatile and can be used for a large variety of irrigating conditions. Most models have an inlet pipe that can be used to draw water from the surface or under ground. Available water output is inversely proportional to the height the pump is lifting the water: the deeper the water, and the higher or further the water is pushed, the less water output is available for the same energy expended. \n\nPump prices, including installation, range between US$20 and $100 based on country of purchase and type of pump.\n\n\n","id":"609","name":"Treadle Pump","category":["agriculture","water"],"tags":"irrigation, collection-storage-and-transport","image":"ast/609-rangpur-tp.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/XmEw-sEoyaU","user_id":"922","created":"2015-02-20 15:55","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/ide-treadle-pump","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"iDE is an international non-profit dedicated to ending poverty in the developing world not through handouts, but by helping farm families access the tools and knowledge they need to increase their income.\n\niDE's origins as a formal organization lie in a visit to a Somalian refugee camp in 1982.

It works by pushing an air-oxygen mix into the mouth and nose at a continuous pressure, keeping airways open and increasing the amount of oxygen entering the blood stream. This breathing aid can be used to help Covid-19 patients with serious respiratory problems to breathe more easily and has been shown to help prevent the need for invasive ventilation.\nThe UCL-Ventura designs and manufacturing instructions have been released to help public health efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic emergency.  Access to this information will be provided at no cost to governments, relevant industry manufacturers, academics and health experts. However, if you do not have access to the manufacturing capabilities to produce devices and you have a specific request for devices to be supplied internationally please contact the team directly.\n\n\nSummary Specs:\n- The device is a stand-alone flow generator. Used in conjunction with the associated circuit, it can provide CPAP support for patients with COVID-19 who are hypoxaemic, tachypnoeic, and have increased work of breathing despite supplemental face mask oxygen.\n- The device is powered purely by 4-bar oxygen (no electricity/medical air required).- The device can provide an oxygen concentration to the patient of 30-95%.\n- The level of CPAP is dictated by the rating of the PEEP valve at the patient mask.\n- Suggested range of operation: CPAP of 5-10 cmH2O, titrate oxygen to targeted SpO2 oxygen. The circuit should be set-up with a 20 cmH2O safety PEEP valve (placed near the oxygen analyser). Patients requiring more support may benefit from more sophisticated devices.\n- The device and the patient circuit has been re-engineered to produce more comfort to the patient in terms of reduced circuit resistance, and significantly reduced oxygen utilization. \n\n","id":"26cmg676","name":"UCL-Ventura CPAP device","category":["medical","covid19"],"tags":"ppe","image":"ast/26cmg676-ucl-cpap-03.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/o6WkHwUl4U8?start=188","created":"2020-05-28 00:38","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/university-college-london-ucl-ventura-cpap-device","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"The UCL-Ventura CPAP device has been developed as a collaboration between University College London (UCL), UCL Hospital and Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains.

Africa’s economy is stunted by opaque markets. Market opacity is driven by a large informal sector (90% of the continent’s GDP) and continued urbanization within the region. As young adults flock to cities for education and work, tribal networks and rural familiarity is lost, making competence and trustworthiness difficult to assess in undocumented, anonymous, highly-populated environments. This results in high transaction costs and friction associated with identifying qualified, reputable talent. Many skilled individuals are jobless and bad actors proceed unrecognized. This cycle erodes economic growth and societal trust.\n\nThe Ubuntu online marketplace (launched August, 2015) allows individuals and SMEs in urban Africa to document their economic activity, review one another on services provided, build their professional reputations, and market their businesses through consumer reviews. Using raw rating data from customers, Proficiency Scores are generated, which quantify a member’s strength at a particular skill.

It requires no registration by the individual users and alerts can be received anywhere in the world. The UgoRound app can be used by multiple agencies at once. Each agency can have access to the 'First to Know' Group which is set up under the jurisdiction of the city. This means people can receive alerts from multiple alert originators. Once the city has established their command and a series of 'First to Know' Groups, they can “share” access to Law Enforcement, Rescue Services, local municipalities etc. \n\nExamples of 'First to Know' Groups include:\n* Places of Worships\n* Schools and Universities\n* Hospitals\n* Local County or Council areas\n* Sporting Events\n* Police Stations\n\nAgencies can use the system for free for up to 2000 members.

UgoRound eliminates the need to “follow” so many social media pages or “go to” websites to find information. The Citizen receives relevant alerts passively. City officials know that people do not like to share their personal information and this is evident in the low sign up rates with the current methods. Research shows only 10 – 20% of people will register to receive an SMS/Email alert. This system eliminates the sign up registering requirement altogether.

In addition to preventing them from being rinsed away, the Ultra Rice grains preserve sensitive micronutrients from degradation during storage. Currently, there are two formulations of Ultra Rice. One carries vitamin A, and the other can carry iron, thiamin, folic acid, and zinc.\n\nThe Ultra Rice technology can be adapted to contain just the nutrients a population needs—and to mimic the look of the local rice.

UoPeople’s mission strives to provide access to undergraduate degree programs for qualified individuals, despite financial, geographic or societal constraints. Currently, UoPeople offers Associate (2-year) and Bachelor (4-year) degree programs in Business Administration and Computer Science. Students must demonstrate English proficiency in order to apply, but introductory English language courses are offered to qualified applicants who do not meet this requirement. Applicants are required to submit an one-time application of $10-$50, based on the student’s native country and economic background. Administrative fees to cover exam processing are covered by a $100 fee per each course. Applicants in need may apply for scholarships.\n\nIn line with other online education platforms, UoPeople operates on a limited budget, employs collaborative and open-source e-learning tools, and hosts online study communities where students share resources and discuss weekly topics. However, UoPeople is distinct in that it offers specific degrees to a selected class. The inaugural class, which began courses in 2009, consisted of 177 students from 49 countries. A community of educators comprised of active and retired professors, librarians, master-level students and other professionals participate in the educational activity and oversee the assessment process of this tuition-free online education model. Former presidents of New York University, the University of Oxford, and the Indian Institute of Technology sit on UoPeople’s President’s Council, a team that works closely with UoPeople’s founder to bring together decades of experience and advance the mission of UoPeople.

Between 2001 and 2004, Reshef also chaired KIT eLearning, the online learning partner of the University of Liverpool and the first online university outside of the United States. In just the past three years, UoPeople has gained numerous distinctions that are recognized worldwide. In 2009, Reshef was listed among the100 Most Creative People in Business by Fast Company and has been awarded an Ashoka fellowship. Press giants such as Business Week, NPR, and the Huffington Post have all touted UoPeople’s success.

This invites deaf children into the world of reading together with their families and friends. Many of these children never enjoy the pleasure of being read to as their families don’t know sign language. Videobooks also helps bridge the gap in literacy skills between deaf and hearing students.\n\nIn this way, the readers become linguistic models, families share stories with deaf children, teachers find tools they can use for education and society can become more inclusive as a whole. The product is a model of bilingual quality education: sign language ensures that hearing-impaired children naturally participate and understand, and Spanish as a second language enables the sharing of culture and information with the society at large.\n\nTo standardize the development of Videobooks, Canales has created a manual describing each step of the process. Containing all technical specifications, it also contains notes on the reading of the text. Sign languages and spoken languages have different grammatic structures and the company endeavors to respect the integrity of both languages.\n\nThe product allows the possibility to read in sign language, the virtual structures enables remote access, readers are navigated with an attractive and clear design and deaf people are also involved in the creation of the product. Since its launch in August 2011, the site has had 130,000 unique visitors and more than one million clicks; over 2,600 students have benefited through direct download.\n\n\n","id":"sa7qxhp","name":"Videobooks in Sign Language","category":["education","partners"],"tags":["teacher-and-student-resources","mobile-and-desktop-applications-edu","empowering-people"],"image":"ast/sa7qxhp-csm-videolibros-8-a8a829332c.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/WOSkBOrboDA","created":"2016-12-13 14:06","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/canales-asociacion-civil-videobooks-in-sign-language","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Over 90% of deaf children have adults around them that can hear and cannot sign. This causes communication problems with subsequent difficulties in language and cognitive development. Limited teaching materials and training affect the possibility for deaf children to integrate with the hearing society and reach their full potential.\n\nThe difficulties that deaf people have in accessing the written language are primarily due to the restricted access to a language at an early age. This solution works to bridge this gap by improving the education of deaf children in Argentina, and one of the ways of doing this is by providing access to literature. Most hearing-impaired children do not have someone who reads them a story when they are young, and are often excluded from stories and literature that most children access. This lack of access hinders both their academic development and their integration in society.\n\nMost teachers of the deaf are not fluent signers and the children are then forced to lip-read, although lip-reading is a very limited tool to access information and reading. The most vulnerable are those in rural areas where there are no schools for the deaf. This excluded population has the opportunity to access literature with the VB site. Stories read by deaf readers encourage communication within families and access to written language, which leads to an improvement in their education.\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/canales-asociacion-civil-videobooks-in-sign-language#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: Yes  \nCountries where available: Worldwide  \nPrice range: Free  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/canales-asociacion-civil-videobooks-in-sign-language#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.videolibros.org  \n\n","_txt":"","url":"http://www.videolibros.org","_href":"/solutions/canales-asociacion-civil-videobooks-in-sign-language#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Canales Asociacion Civil\nurl: http://www.videolibros.org\n\n","_txt":"Silvana Veinberg  \nCanales Asociacion Civil  \nArgentina  \n[info@canales.org.ar](mailto:info@canales.org.ar?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Canales Asociacion Civil","url":"http://www.videolibros.org","_href":"/solutions/canales-asociacion-civil-videobooks-in-sign-language#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/truth-x-vision-village-drill ----\nid: 706\nname: Village Drill\ncategory: water\ntags: collection-storage-and-transport\nimage: /ast/706-vruth-x-vision-village-drill-join-the-party-bkg-800x800.jpg\nvideo: //player.vimeo.com/video/113516982\nuser_id: 1058\ncreated: 2015-06-05 18:36\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"The Village Drill is a low-tech, high-impact manual drill that can reach water 280 feet underground.

The app facilitates referrals across medical specialties including Ophthalmology, Cardiology, Burns & Orthopaedics.  Essentially, Vula puts specialist knowledge into the primary health care worker's pocket, which leads to an increase in quality referrals, cost savings on patient transport, the empowerment of primary health care workers and ultimately improved patient care.\n\nHealth care workers will use the Vula app on their smartphones to assess, record and send patient information to specialists. This includes access to camera functionality, acuity tests, diagnostic information and specialty-specific patient forms.

Fetching water in developing countries is very time-consuming, especially if much water is needed. Using conventional pumps, an average of 5 to 6 gallons per-minute can be pumped from shallow wells. The depth is also limited by the physical power a human can exert in lifting the column of water, which practically is around 230 feet.\n\nThe WaterBuck Pump is a powerful and efficient shallow and deep-well hand pump. The pump is designed to operate the same reciprocating lift pumps as those used in the windmill industry. The mechanics of this unique pump are unlike any conventional water well hand pump, enabling an operator to pump volumes of water from shallow wells with the same effort over conventional manual lift pumps. Practical amounts of water can now be pumped from much greater depths (700 feet is anticipated) under human power. Time spent pumping water needed for daily use can be greatly reduced.\n\nThe limits of the WaterBuck Pump are not yet known considering its newness and a wide variety of applications. However, in comparison to other powerful non-electric pumps with the same application, the WaterBuck exceeds the peak capacity of a 12-foot-diameter windmill by 60%.\n\nThe WaterBuck Pump is a water supply system for communities that have static water levels up to 200 feet with a capacity of up to 55 gallons per-minute. It can also pump uphill, supply water for furrow irrigation and pressurize tanks for drip irrigation or indoor plumbing. The pump can be adapted to accommodate a second lever and twin cylinders, allowing capacity to double with two to four operators pumping simultaneously.  A manual well pump of this caliber can be a great long-term asset for off-grid homesteaders and communities in developing countries. \n\n","id":"572","name":"WaterBuck Pump","category":["agriculture","water"],"tags":"irrigation, collection-storage-and-transport","image":"ast/572-waterbuck-pump-with-pressure-tank-sm.jpg","video":"//www.youtube.com/embed/3Rx5uuE2vao","user_id":"871","created":"2014-11-04 23:45","template":"solution","publish":"tel","_href":"/solutions/well-waterboy-products-waterbuck-pump","#history-and-development":{"_hdr":"---- #history-and-development ----\n\n","_txt":"Within the United States, an increasing number of individuals and communities are choosing to live off-grid for a variety of reasons of economics, privacy and self-sufficiency.

Consisting mainly of a 20-liter box, Waterboxx is placed around a young seedling at the transplanting stage. This box builds up a water column under the plant by collecting dew and rainwater, and distributing it over a long period of time through a wick at the bottom. This prevents evaporation. In practice, the transplanted seedling will receive just enough water from the Waterboxx to survive while it still searches for water deep in the soil. It will therefore develop a strong taproot, making the whole plant resilient to prolonged drought periods.\n\nThe technology works on the same principle as nature: once the seed germinates and develops its root in the capillary column, it reaches water. The leaves then develop and evaporation and photosynthesis can start.

Waterboxx is an inexpensive technology that allows the restoration of degraded ecosystems and the productive use of land.\n\nThe innovation targets the following barriers: firstly, with tree establishment, which is critical for long-term degraded land development and integrated food production.

Lack of refrigeration is one of the main causes of the high spoilage rates for food before it even reaches the consumer. The UN estimates post-harvest losses as high as 45% for fruits and vegetables, with a total loss of 4 billion USD in Africa annually. Given that extending reliable electrification (and therefore traditional refrigeration methods) to everyone in these developing markets is cost-prohibitive, a revolutionary refrigeration solution is needed that does not rely on traditional compression technology which need electricity.\n\nSpecifically, the need for alternative refrigeration solutions in Morocco is illustrated by the current condition of Morocco's cold-chain infrastructure. Total refrigeration capacity in the country is 227,000 tons with only 27,000 tons dedicated to crops. In the context of production capacity, Morocco produces 6,200,000 metric tons of produce per year. Due to the lack of cold storage capacity, Morocco experiences an estimated 30-35% loss of fruit and vegetable crops. This loss impacts the country on all levels of society. It depletes the income of the 75% rural poor who depend on agriculture. Furthermore it impacts the quality of horticultural exports which are the second-largest export segment in the Moroccan economy, making up 15% of the national product.\n\nThe company is currently conducting field tests of the product with rural consumers who rely on expensive transportation for thrice-weekly trips to the market to purchase food, which has to be replaced due to food spoilage.\n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/fenik-yuma-60l#history-and-development"},"#availability":{"_hdr":"---- #availability ----\n\n","_txt":"Publicly available: Yes  \nCountries where available: Morocco  \nPrice range: 20 to 50 USD  \nOffered or can be licensed for local manufacture: No  \n\n\n","_href":"/solutions/fenik-yuma-60l#availability"},"#additional-information":{"_hdr":"---- #additional-information ----\nurl: http://www.fenik.io \nproducturl: https://www.fenik.io/yuma-60l\n    \n\n","_txt":"","url":"http://www.fenik.io","producturl":"https://www.fenik.io/yuma-60l","_href":"/solutions/fenik-yuma-60l#additional-information"},"#contact":{"_hdr":"---- #contact ----\nname: Fenik\nurl: http://www.fenik.com\n\n","_txt":"  \nFenik  \nMorocco  \n[spencer@e-tainers.com](mailto:spencer@e-tainers.com?subject=I found your solution on techxlab.org&cc=notifications@techxlab.org)  \n","name":"Fenik","url":"http://www.fenik.com","_href":"/solutions/fenik-yuma-60l#contact"}},{"_hdr":"---- /solutions/helvetas-swiss-intercooperation-zefra-zero-emission-fridge-for-rural-africa-silo-tehetere ----\nid: 545\nname: ZEFRA: Zero Emission Fridge for Rural Africa / Silo Tehetere\ncategory: energy\ncategory: agriculture\ntags: cooling\nimage: /ast/545-csm-06-zefra-01-7a976c22fa.jpg\nvideo: //www.youtube.com/embed/Mtc1e3UzO08\nuser_id: 484\ncreated: 2014-09-16 15:05\ntemplate: solution\npublish: tel\n\n","_txt":"The 'Zero Emission Fridge for Rural Africa' (ZEFRA) is a seed storage silo made from local materials.

The ceiling lights each provide 80 lumens of light, and will last five hours each on a full day’s solar charge (or 10 hours if only one is used).

Watching educational videos is a great way to learn because it allows kids to build a visual picture or model in their mind. The visual dimension not only helps them understand concepts better, but also stimulates curiosity and encourages self-learning. Educational videos are possibly one of the most effective learning tools, and honestly, even most grown-ups will find them enriching and entertaining as well. \n\nNeoK12 also features Web2.0 tools for learning and teaching. Our School Presentationtool, a mashup of Flickr and Wikipedia, allows users to create and share interesting school presentations online. Our Quizzes, Interactive Diagrams and other Educational Games & Puzzles are a fun, interactive way to improve learning. These are also excellent interactive whiteboard resources for the classroom.

If necessary, the filter can be extended with additional components like inline membrane filters for bacterial and virus protection.
