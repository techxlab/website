<p>TEL is dedicated to bringing communities out of poverty by driving the adoption of innovative, cost-effective and sustainable solutions that improve the lives of the least economically advantaged members of society around the world. </p>
<p>We host a crowdsourced database of over 650 innovations in order to connect practical solutions to the people who need them most. Through our Project Accelerator and Farthest Reach Consulting services, we help international NGOs and communities leverage appropriate technology solutions to maximize the impact of last-mile development around the world. </p>

<p>An international 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, TEL was founded in 2009 by two alumni from the MIT Sloan School of Management. They identified a gap between existing technology-based solutions to problems of poverty, and countless NGOs, local entrepreneurs and developing world communities that lack the time and expertise to identify, assess and acquire appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>TEL closes that gap by empowering last-mile communities with actionable information and the freedom to choose solutions that best suit their needs. Going beyond a catalogue of products and methods, TEL leverages the creativity of innovators, partners and TEL’s own researchers and volunteers. The result: an up-to-date, curated and globally accessible platform for proposing, discovering and sourcing practical technology solutions for the developing world.</p>
<p>Building upon our solutions exchange platform, we actively work with community-based organizations around the world to co-design development programs. Through our <a href="../project-accelerator/">Project Accelerator</a> service, we help communities leverage appropriate technology solutions to maximize the impact of last-mile development. </p>
<p>With a firm belief in the power of bottom-up, human-centered development, we also work with institutional partners and clients looking to introduce innovative products and technologies in developing regions. Through our <a href="../farthest-reach-consulting/">Farthest Reach Consulting Service</a>, we help organizations identify, evaluate and implement innovative solutions to improve the lives of consumers and beneficiaries in underserved communities around the world. </p>

          <h3>Founder, CEO</h3>
          <div data-render-html="/about-us/#persons-person-1"><p>While volunteering in a Haitian clinic, Karen witnessed the toll extreme poverty takes on communities and the environment, and was struck by the resourcefulness of people who live on less than a dollar a day. Meanwhile, the clinic staff was frustrated in its efforts to find appropriate equipment by the lack of a unified, reliable source of information. In order to meet this need on a global basis, she and fellow MIT Sloan School alumnus Gary L. Bergstrom began designing the basics of TEL, with the goal of leveraging technology to help families and communities rise from poverty. After studying political science and economics in Munich, Karen worked as an industrial organization instructor and journalist. She subsequently completed a Master&#39;s degree in Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. As a case manager with the Boston Consulting Group she has consulted to international clients in a variety of industries. Volunteering with the St. Boniface Centre de Santi in Haiti, Karen helped out in the medical-surgical clinic and served as board member and CFO. Two school-years spent in Japan resulted in a deep connection to that country. Karen speaks English, German, French and &#39;yon ti kras&#39; Kreyol.</p>

Parker received his Biomedical Sciences degree from the University of South Alabama and quickly realized that he wanted to work with a broader audience to address health as a human right. Upon this realization he earned his Masters in Public Health from Boston University focusing in global health where he worked with community development organizations in Ghana, Emergency Medicine services in India, and most recently on the implementation and evaluation of a community driven intervention and social enterprise addressing maternal and child health access in Zambia. Through these experiences he learned firsthand that health is not an isolated issue but is effected by your access to resources, education, and community. He believes that TEL&#39;s Database of Solutions, Project Accelerator Programs, and Farthest Reach Consulting address all these by helping communities choose and implement the right solution for their development. </p>
