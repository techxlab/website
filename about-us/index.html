<p>Quality and risk appetite strengthen the board-level executives, while empowerments accelerate a centerpiece. An innovative edge adds value; nevertheless our pre-integrated methodology adequately incentivises the Chief Legal Officer up-front. The key representatives carefully maximize the value.

              <div data-render-html="/about-us/#persons-person-1"><p>While volunteering in a Haitian clinic, Karen witnessed the toll extreme poverty takes on communities and the environment, and was struck by the resourcefulness of people who live on less than a dollar a day. Meanwhile, the clinic staff was frustrated in its efforts to find appropriate equipment by the lack of a unified, reliable source of information. In order to meet this need on a global basis, she and fellow MIT Sloan School alumnus Gary L. Bergstrom began designing the basics of TEL, with the goal of leveraging technology to help families and communities rise from poverty. After studying political science and economics in Munich, Karen worked as an industrial organization instructor and journalist. She subsequently completed a Master&#39;s degree in Finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. As a case manager with the Boston Consulting Group she has consulted to international clients in a variety of industries. Volunteering with the St. Boniface Centre de Santi in Haiti, Karen helped out in the medical-surgical clinic and served as board member and CFO. Two school-years spent in Japan resulted in a deep connection to that country. Karen speaks English, German, French and &#39;yon ti kras&#39; Kreyol.</p>

Brennan first experienced the versatility of low-cost, innovative solutions while living in a squatter settlement outside of Valparaiso, Chile, where composting toilets and eco-adobe architecture were readily accepted. After graduating from Occidental College in 2009 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in Diplomacy and World Affairs, Brennan moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina. There he founded a social enterprise in which American expats provided business English training to CEOs and low-income domestic workers. Brennan then joined an e-commerce startup as CFO. Brennan focuses on maximizing TEL&#39;s impact as it continues to grow in mission and scope. If he&#39;s not at TEL headquarters, you can find Brennan freediving or body surfing in the cold waters off of Cape Ann.</p>
