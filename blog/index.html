<p>Posted by Brennan Lake 7 April 2015 4:14 pm</p>
<p>&quot;Small is beautiful.&quot; So goes the title of British economist, E.F. Schumacher’s manifesto. While his appropriate technology movement has been eclipsed by a wave of social entrepreneurs who &#39;Design for Extreme Affordability&#39;, Schumacher&#39;s mantra is alive and well in Bogotá, Colombia. Located on a small farm tucked between the foothills of the Eastern Andes, Fundación Organizmo is a crucible where diverse methods in sustainable architecture blend with locally sourced and recycled materials to create housing that is as simple in engineering as it is elegant in design.</p>
<p>After studying architecture at the Parson’s School of Design, Fundación Organizmo’s founder, Ana María Gutiérrez, recognized the barriers between the aspirations of ecologically conscious community developers and the skills required to build high-quality, safe and affordable housing. “People get really excited when they see pictures of superadobe houses online, so they watch a 15 minute video on YouTube and think that they can build their dream home, but it’s not that simple,” Gutierrez cautions, “that’s why we’ve created this space for the exchange of practical, hands-on knowledge in bio-construction.”</p>
<p>Organizmo was born out of impromptu amateur workshops in sustainable architecture techniques, led by Gutierrez on her family’s farm. Over the past four years, transient volunteers and apprentices have mastered skills in a variety of techniques - including plastic bottle houses, superadobe, geodesic domes, solar-dried bricks, and more - leaving behind an eclectic village in their wake, and introducing their newly learned skills to developing communities around the world.</p>
<p>“Once we impart the fundamental principles of a given technique,” Gutierrez says, “apprentices can adapt architectural forms to the unique characteristics of their respective communities.” Indeed, one Organizmo fellow from the arid Guajira province of Northern Colombia, and another from the Amazon may both learn how to build a superadobe eco-dome in the mild highlands outside of Bogotá. Applying the same technique within different climatic and cultural contexts, however, produces two distinct solutions to the same fundamental problem: the lack of high-quality and eco-friendly housing.</p>
<p>Organizmo addresses this problem through regular workshops at its campus, and also by partnering with government agencies to bring sustainable housing directly to communities in need. But whether they are helping to build recreational spaces out of recycled materials in a peri-urban neighborhood, or blending new techniques in bio-construction with indigenous practices in the Amazon, Organizmo faces new challenges not experienced when working with like-minded individuals on their own turf.</p>
<p>“We try to strike a balance in meeting the demands of municipal stakeholders, while also delivering culturally-relevant and acceptable habitat solutions,” says Gutierrez. This often takes time, with up to six months dedicated to raising awareness amongst community members, alone. But by nurturing associative, participatory and hands-on skills in bio-construction, Organizmo creates projects in social innovation that are wholly adopted and maintained by the communities they serve.</p>
<p>This type of behavior change is no easy feat, especially when considering that the material ambitions of impoverished Colombians are not so different from those of their middle and upper class counterparts. Organizmo’s answer is not to mollify these populations with the cheapest available solutions in adequate housing, but rather to enable communities to harness the fruits of local ecosystems, in order to create homes and public spaces that consistently grow and improve as communities prosper.</p>

<p>Posted by Juan Trujillo 31 October 2014 12:00 am</p>
<p>“Development moves like a turtle,” muses a resident of Palestina, Peru, a remote Amazonian village accessible only by riverboat. “Wiring the Amazon”, a short documentary by Michael Kleiman, chronicles the progress of Palestina as it struggles to connect to the outside world through satellite telephone and internet connections, accompanied by government programs to bring laptops to students in remote communities.
Speaking with TEL, Michael Kleiman explained that Wiring the Amazon is part of a longer documentary that explores the power of connectivity in accelerating the development of isolated areas.  While the documentary also offers examples of how connectivity can chip away at core values such as community and friendship, Information &amp; Communication Technologies (ICTs) hold promise to reduce poverty, increase productivity and boost economic growth while improving accountability and governance. Last mile communities with ICT infrastructure do far more than chat and play online games. They learn where it is best to fish and at which markets to sell their products. They trace cattle from pastures to supermarkets. They pay bills, send remittances and receive cash transfers. They do business on mobile phones.  They utilize the tools in ways that better their lives and increase productivity.</p>
<p>Indeed, strong demand for increased connectivity in communities like Palestina is driving governments, NGOs and the private sector to deliver sustainable solutions.  Globally there are four billion people not yet using the Internet, 90% of whom live in developing countries. Internet penetration rates have reached 70% in developed countries, but lag at 32% in developing countries. In Peru 64% of rural villages have access to mobile phones while only 11.9% have access to internet.  But isolated communities exhibit a perfect storm of complex characteristics that make the successful introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) a huge challenge. Among these obstacles are high geographic dispersion, lack of electricity and infrastructure, high levels of poverty and illiteracy, and small populations.  Combined, these challenges have historically repelled private sector telcos and stymied government intervention.  </p>
<p>In Peru, however, the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunication is funding projects in collaboration with a coalition of NGOs and private telcos to make remote connectivity a reality.  Among them is GTR-PUCP or ‘The Rural Telecommunications Research Group’, a Peruvian organization focused on the development and promotion of rural telecommunications in Latin America.  In conversations with TEL, GTR-PUCP co-founder Luis Camacho pointed to two key factors in tackling problems of remote connectivity: orgware and well-trained personnel.  While solid orgware requires community leaders and decision makers to welcome and support development projects, for any project to be sustainable in the long term it is also necessary to ensure that community members are trained in the capacity to maintain hardware and systems. Citing connectivity projects in the Peruvian Amazon begun over seven years ago, for which local communities still count on his team for maintenance support, Camacho underscored problems of programmatic sustainability when such dependence is a factor.</p>
<p>Based on his time spent in Palestina, Michael Kleiman is inclined to agree.  While he notes the enthusiasm with which villagers embraced the arrival of phone and internet access, Kleiman&#39;s work conveys the frustration of community leaders in Palestina who were unequipped to perform routine maintenance on routers and laptops.  Camacho suggests that failed outcomes can be averted by not only providing improved training and capacitation programs to community stakeholders, but also by utilizing simpler yet equally robust communication technologies. GTR PUCP points to wireless alternatives that are both cost-effective and easy to install compared to wired solutions, including Wi-Fi, VHF (Very High Frequency) and HF (High Frequency) radio communications, WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), and VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminals) satellite communication. No matter the technology, a renewable energy source and a well-established evaluation and monitoring system are essential for rural connectivity to succeed.</p>
<p>Although Palestina has enjoyed renewed - even if sporadic - internet connectivity since initial implementation, ‘Wiring the Amazon’ ends with scenes of broken student laptops from the One Laptop Per Child program (OLPC).  “Dump hardware in schools, hope for magic to happen.”  So goes a ‘worst practice’ for ICT in education, as expressed by Michal Trucano, ICT &amp; Education Specialist with the World Bank.  While Trucano indicates that the Peruvian government’s intent was to “combine the provision of laptops with a pedagogical model targeted toward increased achievement by students,” the program’s rollout was plagued by insufficient educational content, teacher training and - especially in the case of rural communities - technological maintenance and upkeep.</p>

<p>Posted by Brennan Lake 20 March 2014 12:00 am</p>
<p>What would it take to revitalize depleted soil in an area the size of Nebraska while also economically empowering low-income populations and women?  Governments often turn to investment in chemicals and infrastructure as the obvious approach.  But at the grassroots level in Karnataka, India, it&#39;s all being accomplished with worms, women, a few low-cost tablets and cartloads of manure.</p>
<p>Jaya Organic Yojana (JOY) is not a business or an NGO, but rather a movement that leverages the collective power and networks of 300 Indian non-profits to restore soil fertility and provide business opportunities for thousands of impoverished villagers and farmers, just by switching to organic farming and composting.  At the core of JOY’s activity is a training program that teaches thousands of villagers (most of whom are women) how to create nutrient-rich fertilizer through vermiculture, a process of composting that uses live earthworms, manure and green waste.  Villagers can secure a livelihood by selling the fertilizer to farmers, who in turn benefit from organic farming practices.</p>
<p>While ‘organic’ and ‘wealth’ have different connotations in developed countries (the latter often being a prerequisite to obtaining the former), according to JOY’s founder, Smita Shah, JOY is “not concerned with selling organic produce at high prices, but rather with making the soil healthy.”  Local farmers agree, and express eagerness to go organic. “Chemical farming is expensive,” explains Shah. &quot;It drains the farmer’s pocket as well as her land.  With the damage to the land, more and more additives are required to get a good harvest.”  </p>
<p>Shah has been a lot of things in her life - NYU film student, musician, activist, self-proclaimed hippie - but throughout her life she has been consistently inspired by the landscape of Southern India, a landscape now depleted from decades of exposure to chemical fertilizers.  JOY is the culmination of Shah’s work to address problems of drought and soil degradation head-on, while also boosting prosperity and nutrition for the region’s population. “We are painting the landscape”, Shah says.  &quot;It&#39;s a work of art and when we are done the Karnataka belt will become organic, and chemical free!”</p>
<p>Assisted by microloans, villagers pay Rs 11,000 (USD $177) to participate in JOY’s six-month training program.  The program includes a toolkit for three composting beds with live earthworms, and extensive on-site training seminars that use low-cost tablet computers to show instructional videos and collect data remotely.  The remaining supplies are easy to come by, says Shah, “waste material that would otherwise be burnt is converted into life-giving compost.” And the payoff is sweet: for villagers, Rs 22,500 (USD $362) every sixty days from selling compost and surplus earthworms to farmers; for farmers, a sustainable alternative to costly chemical fertilizers; for the region, reasonably priced organic produce and a fertile landscape.</p>
<p>Vermiculture, popularized in India over the past forty years by Dr. Radha Kale, is a newcomer to the subcontinent’s 10,0000+ year-old agricultural scene.  To disrupt the status quo, JOY operates like an agile startup, blending traditional, village-based networking and canvassing with mobile communication, cloud computing and even viral marketing.  Having mapped out hundreds of villages across Karnataka, JOY representatives have already begun training village organizers, who in turn recruit and train locals for the vermicompost program.  Participants sign up on tablets, and all data is then uploaded to the cloud at wifi hotspots.  To reach prospective participants, JOY operates in partnership with Sumangali Seva Ashrama, a vast network of 300 NGOs operating throughout 8,000 villages.  With support from this network, and an endorsement from its decorated founder, S.G. Susheelama, JOY’s brand carries serious clout.</p>
<p>Still, some additional advertising doesn’t hurt. “We are also creating branded products - t-shirts, backpacks, caps, coffee mugs - and as if that weren’t enough,” adds Shah, “we are also getting Hamsalekha, a famous film composer, to create our homemade Field Workers song, and a choreographer from the Kannada film industry to work with these same field workers to create a music video.”  The ultimate goal? “To train 10,080 people this year, and 200,000 rural people at the bottom of the pyramid in the next ten years.”</p>
<p>With a strong viral coefficient, JOY’s potential for socioeconomic as well as environmental impact in India is enormous.  “What [JOY] is doing will mitigate urban migration,” Shah claims. “It gives youth a reason and a livelihood to remain in the countryside, it reverses damage.” This prospect has caught the attention of the public sector, with up to USD $1,000,000 in grants and loans in the pipeline from the Indian government.
Given its nascent stage, skeptics may dismiss the vision of Jaya Organic Yojana as overly idealistic.  But the ambitious movement is based on proven methodologies and rigorous data collection, and ample support at the community and government levels further bolsters JOY’s prospects for success.  JOY is also certain to be propelled in the longer term by India’s burgeoning demand for organic foods, Smita Shah’s delightful quip notwithstanding: “May ‘certification’ rest in glory, and the soil live on!”</p>

<p>Posted by Dan Swann 24 October 2013 12:00 am</p>
<p>A Talk with Founder Faith Wallace-Gadsden</p>
<p>The Archimedes Project is holding a kickoff event November 1-3 at Impact Hub Boston and Cambridge Innovation Center that will bring together people from several sectors – including technology, health, disaster relief, and academia – to form a social enterprise aimed at eliminating cholera in Haiti.</p>
<p>There have been over 8,000 deaths from cholera since the recent widespread outbreak began in 2010. Archimedes Project founder Faith Wallace notes that, while many interventions have been successful in reducing the number of infections and deaths, the disease has yet to be eliminated from Haiti. Without a stronger response, the epidemic is likely to persist.</p>
<p>“Conditions are perfect for cholera: 80 percent of the people lack sanitation coverage in Haiti, and 50 percent lack access to clean water. If nothing changes to treat the problem, the disease will continue to devastate Haiti as a yearly endemic as it has Bangladesh.”</p>
<p>We interviewed Faith Wallace to learn more about why she started the Archimedes Project and to invite her to share her firsthand experiences seeing the effects of cholera in Haiti.</p>
<p><em>What inspired you to form the Archimedes Project and combat cholera in Haiti? Can you share any anecdotes regarding the situation in Haiti you are trying to combat?</em></p>
<p>I was inspired in large part by the work I was already doing. I am a PhD candidate in molecular microbiology at Tufts Medical School studying cholera, and my research area has long been in diarrhea disease because it is a leading killer of children under the age of five. My work first centered on understanding the specific mechanisms that diarrhea-causing E. coli use to resist killing by antibiotics. My doctoral work focused on understanding the molecular basis of the rapid spread of cholera.</p>
<p>In October 2010, Haiti experienced a cholera outbreak. Within two weeks of the outbreak, I had established a collaboration with Saint Nicola Hospital in Saint Marc, the hospital at the epicenter of the outbreak, to collect patient samples. When I arrived in Haiti, I found a country still deeply scarred by the January 2010 earthquake: displaced people filled the squares and streets of Port-au-Prince. Destroyed buildings were everywhere. And people were dealing with a new horror: cholera.</p>
<p>What I also found was commerce. I found men selling bottles of water and SIM cards in the street, women selling fruits in the markets, children in their uniforms going to school. I also found an international community completely incapable of coordinating the hundreds of foreign aid workers trying to stop the cholera outbreak.</p>
<p><em>Many attempts have been made to combat cholera in Haiti and they have been largely unsuccessful. Why do you think that is?</em></p>
<p>The efforts to combat cholera in Haiti have been successful. The number of cases has been drastically reduced, as have the number of deaths. What they haven’t done is eliminate the disease from the country.</p>
<p>Originally, I started my graduate work in cholera molecular biology because I thought that a treatment or a vaccine could have the most positive impact. I went to Haiti and saw them try to fight the spread of cholera with the simplest intervention: the chlorine tablet. Seeing that effort fail showed me it is not about the intervention; it is about distribution. How do you get even the most basic technology to 10 million people?</p>
<p>From then on I soaked myself in information about the most successful large-scale interventions in water. Water is a local issue in so many ways. It is also a regional and community issue. You can treat your water in your own house, but at the end of the day you and especially your children are going to get water somewhere other than your house, and when you do, if your neighbors and your neighbors’ neighbors aren&#39;t treating their water, you are at risk of infection.</p>
<p>For me, there was a disconnect: an international community unable to get chlorine tablets to every household and a populace not only wanting a solution but also eager to work. I realized people want to work, and people want water. People in Haiti pay for water, not only directly in cash, but also indirectly in time, lost work, missed school, poor health, and, when there is cholera, in death. I began to ask if it was possible to marry the need for work with the need for clean water.</p>
<p><em>How do you think technology can play a successful role in the response to cholera? Are there technologies you are eager to see deployed?</em></p>
<p>What became clear to me is that the programs that seem to work the best have an internally-driven component. The strongest motive is an economic motive. That’s what got me thinking, “Well, we have technologies that work and a need for profit in a place where the economy is suffering in part from this problem. Why not try to use technology both to protect people from this disease and to help them build a better economy?”</p>
<p>The technologies that interest me most are ones that are practical, scalable, and actually work. I did recently learn about electrochlorinators − systems that use an electric current to disinfect water − and am interested in including them in the project. They are low cost, simple to use, and easy to deploy in a big way. Paul Polak’s Spring Health has deployed them in India in an exciting way. In Haiti, one of our technology partners, Antenne, has an electrochlorinator called the WATA that has been deployed in Haiti. I&#39;m interested to seeing if any of the teams pick up that technology in their plans.</p>
<p><em>Describe the Archimedes Project and your November kickoff event. How do you think this event can contribute to improving the situation in Haiti?</em></p>
<p>The Archimedes Project will bring together 50 people from across business, non-profit, academic, and government sectors for a collaborative event that will design an actionable and scalable water or sanitation social business driven by local entrepreneurs. With the advice of the experts who understand water and sanitation, who understand Haiti, who understand business, these young professionals and students will come up with plans that could be launched in Haiti.</p>
<p>We will then actually launch them in collaboration with our partners. We are going to design a large-scale system over the course of the weekend. Over the following days, weeks and months, we will launch that program: first in one location, then across the country. The goal is to be on the ground, operating, finding out what works, adjusting the plan and scaling within one year.</p>
<p><em>What sort of projects or initiatives do you hope will emerge from the event?</em></p>
<p>The goal of the Archimedes Project is to produce a large-scale clean water social enterprise in Haiti that uses low-energy technology. It will be a micro-enterprise or micro-franchise and piloted with an experienced on-the-ground partner. The nature of the plan will be determined by the groups and will depend on their ideas and experiences.</p>
<p><em>Are you currently partnering with any NGOs or government agencies in Haiti? What are the goals of these partnerships?</em></p>
<p>Yes. We are very luck to have many Haitian partners. We have partners who work in water and sanitation and are acting as advisors to the project. These organizations have worked in the water or sanitation space in Haiti and have a deep knowledge of the topic. We are thrilled that two organizations − Safe Water Haiti and Pure Water for the World − are sending their directors to join us in November!</p>
<p>We are also partnering with organizations that have a strong and longstanding presence in a community. They will advise teams during the event and will support us as we pilot the plan that comes out of the Archimedes Project.</p>
<p>As for the goals of these partnerships, an important aspect of the Archimedes Project is the Lean Startup model of quickly implementing a plan in order to find out what works and what doesn&#39;t. It is our goal to get on the ground as quickly as possible and start finding out what elements we come up with in Boston will translate in Haiti and what won’t. From there we can iterate and scale.</p>
<p>Having partners all over the country will allow us to form nucleii from which we can build. We will be thinking globally but acting locally, recognizing that each region may have specific characteristics that we will have to be flexible enough to address. We are so excited to get started!</p>
<p>Have an idea for the Archimedes Project? Want to participate? Tweet to them @ArchGrp to learn more and help share their story.</p>

<p>Posted by Dan Swann 16 July 2013 12:00 am</p>
<h2 id="q-a-with-suneet-singh-tuli-ceo-of-datawind-ltd-">Q &amp; A with Suneet Singh Tuli, CEO of Datawind, Ltd.</h2>
<p>Datawind, Ltd. is a company based in the United Kingdom that seeks to “bridge the digital divide” by offering low cost platforms and devices to connect people in rural, off-the-grid regions to the internet. In 2011, Datawind formed a high-profile partnership with the Indian government to distribute their touted Aakash Tablet, now called “the cheapest tablet in the world.”  </p>
<p>Datawind is the manufacturer of two products already featured in TEL’s database of solutions aimed at closing gaps in education and information technology: the UbiSlate7Ci Tablet; and the UbiSlate7C+ Tablet/ Smartphone. We were fortunate to be able to interview Suneet Singh Tuli, CEO of Datawind, catching him “on the fly” via Skype on his flight to London.</p>
<p><em>What inspired the creation of Datawind, and your mission of connecting the developing world to the internet?</em></p>
<p>Originally, Datawind was started because we had ideas on how to provide internet access in developing countries’ networks.  </p>
<p>For me, at a personal level, it was about bridging the “digital divide,” which has always been a passion. I left India at the age of 8, and I didn’t have a sense of what the divisions in social classes [in Indian society] were. I realized, while growing up in Canada, that people in lower social classes would not have the same education as me.  </p>
<p>I wanted to use technology to bridge the digital divide. You don’t need a lot of infrastructure — it is already present in India. You don’t need a lot of bandwidth. You can offer free mobile internet in [Indian] markets.  </p>
<p><em>What is your business model? How do you distribute Datawind products in the countries where you work? How does Datawind find and choose recipients and customers of their products? How do you instruct new users?</em></p>
<p>We’re big believers that a sense of affordability is key. We strive to continue to lower the costs of hardware. We do sell products to governments, and we encourage them to use technology to improve the quality of education, but we also sell to consumers in these markets.  </p>
<p>We encourage governments to help us deliver better quality education. We also sell directly to consumers through cellular phone distribution channels. In any of these places where people sell cell phones, by getting the price point down 50 points or lower, we can sell in places where people would already sell cell phones, whereas computers would cost more. We can get a broader reach by doing that.  </p>
<p>In most countries, we first go in and pitch to the local government and advertise to them the benefits of using this technology in this manner. We then do it commercially. We advertise and offer products online.  We either let [consumers] come to us or use the local government to find a channel to carry our products.  </p>
<p>We don’t do a lot of consumer or end user training. With education, we do a lot of training to show how to integrate [Datawind products] into the curriculum. We find the interface to be so user friendly that that new users can pick up on it by playing around. The graphic arts allow for a short learning curve.  </p>
<p><em>Do you partner with any other companies or organizations?</em></p>
<p>We do end up donating and helping pilot projects in the field. We try to partner with content developers and providers that focus around education. We do a lot of work with NGOs working on women&#39;s empowerment or training entrepreneurs.  An example would be appstoempower.org, an effort to get people developing apps for the social good. At least a billion more people will be on the internet in the next three years as the cost lowers. These apps help the overall social good.  </p>
<p><em>How did the Indian government come to recognize the potential of your Aakash tablet? What impact do you feel your products have had in India?</em></p>
<p>After a lot of effort and about 10 years of presentations, including the efforts of One Laptop Per Child, the government began to see these technologies as crucial to making improvements in the education of the children of India.  </p>
<p>I thinks it’s early to measure our impact on education and people’s lives, but certainly we’ve seen the cost of computers in the market drop. Certainly the impact has been affordability and increased demand because of affordable prices.  </p>
<p>I’m very confident it will help empower people in many ways, empowering people with that kind of access to the best quality education, the type that anyone has available around the world.  </p>
<p><em>Do you have any favorite anecdotes about the difference your tablet or another product has made in the developing world?</em></p>
<p>There are stories of how we see NGOs deploy and sell [our products]. One of the NGOs mentors women entrepreneurs, but the challenge is, with that mission, how do you reach out and mentor? So they are using Skype and apps on our products to mentor.  </p>
<p>What’s interesting is that if they are tablets, you start to see multiple units in the family using them. I often get asked the question, What is the right age to get started? Is there an age too young? I see them often used as pacifiers. We are going to see children growing up with access using them at a very early age.</p>

<p>Posted by TEL Team 12 December 2012 12:00 am</p>
<p>Written by Betsy Teutsch and Chidinma Moito, MD</p>
<p>My first contact with Technology Exchange Lab (TEL) was almost by accident, through their Facebook page. I remember being filled with so much excitement after scanning through, and then going ahead to take a detailed look at the TEL website! It was exciting to me because up until then I had never seen such a huge compendium of resources available for use in low-resource centers such as where I grew up and attended school. The constraints faced in developing countries are hardly imaginable if you haven&#39;t lived and worked in the settings. Imagine my great joy as I browsed through the TEL website and saw innovative tools such as solar powered autoclave machines, LED lights operating without a plug, clean water solutions, and numerous other products that met vital needs. My greatest excitement was the realization, through TEL, that technology is being produced that works around a lot of the complexities faced in Africa and other developing countries. All in one location!</p>
<p>As a physician trained and practicing in Nigeria, the discovery of such as useful resource is humbling. For me, it not only serves the purpose of presenting simple solutions to gigantic problems I face on a daily basis in practice; it also serves to provide links to solution providers and the opportunity for problems to meet their solutions! For me, TEL is an excellent platform for solution makers and solution seekers to interact, and through this &#39;little step&#39; of connecting, step by step, we can make a difference at every level. Great job, TEL!</p>
<p>Betsy Teutsch, author of 100 Under $100: the Women’s Global Toolkit</p>
<p>A few months ago, Dana Raviv over at Catchafire told me about Technology Exchange Lab, a group creating a developing world technology catalog, a bit like my book project. First I freaked out. Then I got excited. There are a billion women who need improved technology, and here’s a chance to collaborate. How wonderful the TEL folks feel just the same way. Thanks, Dana!</p>
<p>Back in the day working for GreenMicrofinance, I learned about energy and sanitation poverty, and was impressed by the ingenious, eco-smart solutions helping to eradicate these immense drags on women’s productivity. Recently I joined Dining For Women, a growing network of over 350 local Giving Circles which together support women’s global empowerment. Focusing on girls’ and women’s legal, educational, health, and discrimination problems is super important, but I kept thinking: something very basic is missing. Technology.</p>
<p>The tech world is buzzing with appropriate, entry-level developing world offerings, but – as in the developed world – the tech sector is male-dominated. Women are rarely included in technology design and application. One notable exception is Dr. Pilar Mateo, a Spanish chemist and humanitarian, inventor of an insecticide-infused paint that repels the vampire-like insects that spread Chagas disease. Why do more people not know of her breakthrough work? Making sure people do is the goal of 100 Under $100, a catalog of 100 products and practices under $100 that will specifically help women climb the ladder out of extreme poverty, together</p>
<p>One of the solutions in TEL’s database is the LifePlayer, the first MP3-enabled multi-band radio designed and engineered for the humanitarian sector. It has the potential to change the rhythms of women’s daily lives. I quite agree with Tom Hanks, LifePlayer’s ambassador, – we can’t envision all the ways the LifePlayer will spark creativity. Using its recording capacity, imagine how exciting it will be for women to hear their own voices and broadcast their own truths!  </p>
<p>We all love a good story. The soap operas so beloved by past generations have proven to be an excellent format for disseminating public health information. Women working together, while they listen to the daily installment – they are the ones that will fight for clean water and schooling for their daughters. And when they hear about Pilar Mateo on their LifePlayer they will want that magic paint. Next thing, they’ll be lobbying for a paint factory in their country, and the next thing after that, they’ll be selling and applying the paint. I can’t wait!</p>

<p>Posted by TEL Team 1 September 2008 12:00 am</p>
<p>Amy Smith, Inventor Amy Smith, a practitioner of humanitarian engineering, wants to solve everyday problems for rural families in the developing world.</p>
<p>Amy Smith, who has a master&#39;s degree in mechanical engineering and teaches at MIT, isn&#39;t interested in building faster computers or bigger jetliners. She&#39;s thinking about how to cook dinner in a Haitian slum. Most of Haiti has been deforested, few people have electricity, and fossil fuels are prohibitively expensive. But there&#39;s something Haiti has a lot of: bagasse, or sugar-cane fibers left over after processing. Smith and her students have developed a way to turn this plentiful (and otherwise useless) material into clean-burning charcoal by carbonizing it in a covered oil drum. It&#39;s a simple solution to a simple problem, but—like many of Smith&#39;s projects—it makes a big difference in ordinary people&#39;s lives.</p>
<p>Smith, a practitioner of humanitarian engineering, wants to solve everyday problems for rural families in the developing world: where to find clean water, how to preserve vegetables for market, how to do laundry without electricity or plumbing. Smith&#39;s inventions include a hammer mill for grinding grain into flour—a task African women usually do by hand—and a portable kit to test drinking water for contaminating bacteria. Smith, who was awarded a Macarthur Fellowship in 2004, runs MIT&#39;s IDEAS Competition, for which teams of student engineers design projects to make life easier in the developing world.</p>
<p><em>What would you say was the coolest project that you&#39;ve worked on?</em></p>
<p>Well, it&#39;s not very romantic, but I think our charcoal project is going to have a huge impact, because it allows you to have a clean-burning fuel without cutting down trees. We&#39;re planning large-scale dissemination in Haiti. There&#39;s no glitz factor to it, but it&#39;s probably going to make a huge amount of difference.</p>
<p><em>Have the inventions that come out of your class and out of the IDEAS competition proved successful in the field?</em></p>
<p>Some of the IDEAS competition winners have been very successful. The compound water filter, which removes arsenic and pathogens, is now deployed quite extensively in Nepal. The Kinkajou microfilm projector, used in nighttime literacy classes, is being deployed in Mali. We’re working to commercialize a system for testing water for potability. It&#39;s in the field in several countries, but not on a widespread basis. We&#39;re looking towards doing a trial of aerosol vaccines in Pakistan, so that&#39;s exciting.</p>
<p><em>What is the biggest problem facing rural communities in the developing world?</em></p>
<p>I don&#39;t think you can say there&#39;s a single one. Obviously access to safe drinking water is a huge problem, and lack of access to opportunities, and general poverty. But if you get people safe drinking water, and then they still have no way to earn any money to feed their families, you still have a problem. And if you give them better methods of agricultural processing or ways to create clean energy, but there&#39;s still drinking water that makes them sick, you still have a problem. There are too many interrelated issues, so solving one problem won&#39;t completely change the lives of millions.</p>
<p><em>You lived in India as a child and you were in the Peace Corps in Botswana in the 1980s. How did those experiences lead to what you&#39;re doing now?</em></p>
<p>As a very young child I was exposed to very severe poverty, so I always wanted to do something to help kids around the world. Living in India is something that stayed with me—I could put faces on the kids who had so little money. In Botswana, I was teaching and then working for the ministry of agriculture as a beekeeper, and I remember thinking to myself that I really liked doing development work, but I wished could do some engineering too, because I like creative problem solving. People in the developing world scrape every last ounce of life that they can out of objects, and my students used to bring me things to fix, and I always enjoyed being able to do that.</p>
<p><em>You’ve said that engineering schools focus too much on defense and consumer electronics—what changes would you like to see in the way engineering is taught?</em></p>
<p>AdvertisementIt would be great if students recognized that engineering with a humanitarian focus is as legitimate as aerospace and automotive engineering. Service learning is actually a very good way to teach engineering, because it motivates students to continue, and it appeals especially to women and minorities.</p>
<p><em>You are a woman in what is still a male-dominated field. What can we do to encourage more women to become engineers?</em></p>
<p>Actually, because my class involves humanitarian engineering, I very rarely have more men than women. There have been times where there have been ten women and one man. This isn&#39;t surprising, given that women often want to see an application to what they&#39;re learning that they feel is worthwhile. But I&#39;m not involved in any particular projects to encourage women engineers, because I dislike being referred to as a woman engineer. I don&#39;t like programs that single out woman engineers as particular achievers just for being women. I think that it should be coincidental. What we should be striving for is a world where when we see women or minorities who are high achievers, it isn&#39;t surprising. We shouldn&#39;t be thinking, &quot;Good for them!&quot; just because of their race or gender. I think we&#39;re a long, long way from that, but I don&#39;t think we should keep implying that there&#39;s something special about being a woman engineer. I want people who meet me to say, &quot;I like the work that you&#39;re doing.&quot; I want to be known as an engineer who designs solutions for the developing world. After that people can notice that I&#39;m a woman.</p>
